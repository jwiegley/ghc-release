   =============================================================
    The (Interactive) Glasgow Haskell Compiler -- version 7.2.2
   =============================================================

The GHC Team is pleased to announce a new bugfix release of GHC, 7.2.2.

The 7.2 branch is intended to be more of a "technology preview" than
normal GHC stable branches; in particular, it supports a significantly
improved version of DPH, as well as new features such as compiler
plugins and "safe Haskell". The design of these new features may evolve
as we get more experience with them.

The changes in this release, relative to 7.2.1, are:

* All packages are now trusted by default. If you wish to make use
  of Safe Haskell, you will need to manually untrust packages that
  you do not wish to trust.

* An optimiser bug which can cause segfaults has been fixed.

* A native code generator bug which can cause segfaults on x86 and
  amd64 has been fixed.

* A race condition in the runtime system that can cause segfaults
  has been fixed.

* Exception handlers are now run in the mask state, rather than the
  maskUninterruptible state. Fixes a bug that could cause the GHCi
  debugger to hang amongst other things.

* The shutdownHaskellAndExit function now immediately exits, even
  if hs_init has been called multiple times.

* A bug arising when using type signature declarations in Template
  Haskell splices has been fixed.

* A bug arising when using class instances in Template Haskell
  splices has been fixed.

* Incorrectly encoded text at the end of a file is now handled
  correctly.

* The base package is now version 4.4.1.0 (was 4.4.0.0).

* Haddock is now version 2.9.4.


How to get it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easy way is to go to the web page, which should be self-explanatory:

        http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

We supply binary builds in the native package format for many
platforms, and the source distribution is available from the same
place.

Packages will appear as they are built - if the package for your
system isn't available yet, please try again later.


Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Haskell is a standard lazy functional programming language.

GHC is a state-of-the-art programming suite for Haskell.  Included is
an optimising compiler generating good code for a variety of
platforms, together with an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.  The distribution includes space and time profiling
facilities, a large collection of libraries, and support for various
language extensions, including concurrency, exceptions, and foreign
language interfaces (C, whatever).  GHC is distributed under a
BSD-style open source license.

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interpreters, references,
contact information, links to research groups) are available from the
Haskell home page (see below).


On-line GHC-related resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relevant URLs on the World-Wide Web:

Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list of platforms we support, and the people responsible for them,
is here:

Ports to other platforms are possible with varying degrees of
difficulty.  The Building Guide describes how to go about porting to a
new platform:

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

We welcome new contributors.  Instructions on accessing our source
code repository, and getting started with hacking on GHC, are
available from the GHC's developer's site run by Trac:
