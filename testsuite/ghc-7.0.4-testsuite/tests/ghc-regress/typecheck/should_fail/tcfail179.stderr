    Couldn't match type `x' with `s'
      `x' is a rigid type variable bound by
          a pattern with constructor

      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for run :: T s -> Int at tcfail179.hs:13:1
    Expected type: x -> s
      Actual type: x -> x
    In the second argument of `g', namely `id'
    In the expression: g x id
