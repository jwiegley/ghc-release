    No instance for (Eq (m (Maybe a)))
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Eq (m (Maybe a)))
      or use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
           so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Eq (MaybeT m a))
