    Could not deduce (Memo d ~ Memo d0)
    from the context (Fun d)
      bound by the type signature for f :: Fun d => Memo d a -> Memo d a
      at NoMatchErr.hs:20:1-15
    NB: `Memo' is a type function, and may not be injective
    Expected type: Memo d a
      Actual type: Memo d0 a
    Expected type: Memo d a -> Memo d a
      Actual type: Memo d0 a -> Memo d0 a
    In the expression: abst . appl
    In an equation for `f': f = abst . appl
