T1900.hs:11:13:
    No instance for (Num ())
      arising from the literal `1'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num ())
    In the second argument of `(+)', namely `1'
    In the expression: (+ 1)
    In an equation for `trans': trans = (+ 1)

T1900.hs:14:22:
    Could not deduce (Depend s0 ~ Depend s)
    from the context (Bug s)
      bound by the type signature for check :: Bug s => Depend s -> Bool
      at T1900.hs:14:1-22
    NB: `Depend' is a type function, and may not be injective
    In the first argument of `trans', namely `d'
    In the second argument of `(==)', namely `trans d'
    In the expression: d == trans d
