    Couldn't match type `forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a'
                  with `IO a'
    Expected type: (forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a) -> IO a
      Actual type: (forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a)
                   -> forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a
    In the second argument of `(.)', namely `id'
    In the expression: id . id
    In an equation for `foo': foo = id . id
