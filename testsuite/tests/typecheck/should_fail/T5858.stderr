T5858.hs:11:7:
    No instance for (InferOverloaded ([a0], [a1]))
      arising from a use of `infer'
    The type variables `a0', `a1' are ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Note: there is a potential instance available:
      instance t1 ~ String => InferOverloaded (t1, t1)
        -- Defined at T5858.hs:8:10
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (InferOverloaded ([a0], [a1]))
    In the expression: infer ([], [])
    In an equation for `foo': foo = infer ([], [])
