    No instance for (Ord_ a0) arising from a use of `gt'
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      search :: a0 -> [a0] -> Bool (bound at tcfail043.hs:37:1)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
                  or use -XNoMonomorphismRestriction
    Note: there is a potential instance available:
      instance Ord_ Int -- Defined at tcfail043.hs:34:10
    In the expression: gt (hd bs) a
    In the expression:
      if gt (hd bs) a then
          False
      else
          if eq a (hd bs) then True else search a (tl bs)
