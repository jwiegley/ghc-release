    Couldn't match type `[Char]' with `Int'
    When using functional dependencies to combine
      ?x::[Char],
        arising from the implicit-parameter bindings for ?x
        at T5246.hs:(10,7)-(11,12)
      ?x::Int, arising from a use of `foo' at T5246.hs:11:10-12
    In the expression: foo
    In the expression: let ?x = "hello" in foo
