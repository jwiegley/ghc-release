T5300.hs:15:9:
    Could not deduce (C1 a1 b2 c0) arising from a use of `f1'
    from the context (Monad m, C1 a1 b1 c1, C2 a2 b2 c2)
      bound by the type signature for
                 f2 :: (Monad m, C1 a1 b1 c1, C2 a2 b2 c2) =>
                       a1 -> StateT (T b2) m a2
      at T5300.hs:14:7-69
    The type variable `c0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the first argument of `(>>=)', namely `f1 fm'
    In the expression: f1 fm >>= return . undefined
    In an equation for `f2': f2 fm = f1 fm >>= return . undefined
