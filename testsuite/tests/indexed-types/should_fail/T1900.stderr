T1900.hs:11:12:
    No instance for (Num ()) arising from a use of `+'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num ())
    In the expression: (+ 1)
    In an equation for `trans': trans = (+ 1)
    In the instance declaration for `Bug Int'

T1900.hs:14:16:
    Could not deduce (Depend s ~ Depend s0)
    from the context (Bug s)
      bound by the type signature for check :: Bug s => Depend s -> Bool
      at T1900.hs:13:10-36
    NB: `Depend' is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable `s0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the return type of a call of `trans'
    In the second argument of `(==)', namely `trans d'
    In the expression: d == trans d
