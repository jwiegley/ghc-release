    Couldn't match type `TFn a' with `TFn a0'
    NB: `TFn' is a type function, and may not be injective
    When checking that `x' has the inferred type `forall a. TFn a'
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
    In the expression:
      do { let Just x = ...;
           let n = fst x + fst x;
           return () }
    In an equation for `f':
        f = do { let Just x = ...;
                 let n = ...;
                 return () }

    Couldn't match type `TFn a3' with `(a2, b0)'
    In the first argument of `fst', namely `x'
    In the first argument of `(+)', namely `fst x'
    In the expression: fst x + snd x

    Couldn't match type `TFn a5' with `(a4, a2)'
    In the first argument of `snd', namely `x'

    In the expression: fst x + snd x

T2693.hs:28:20:
    Couldn't match type `TFn a0' with `PVR a1'
    Expected type: () -> Maybe (PVR a1)
      Actual type: () -> Maybe (TFn a0)
    In the first argument of `mapM', namely `g'
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: pvs <- mapM g undefined
