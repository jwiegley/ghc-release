    Could not deduce (STerm a0 ~ STerm a)
    from the context (OTerm a ~ STerm a, OBJECT a, SUBST a)
      bound by the type signature for
                 fce' :: (OTerm a ~ STerm a, OBJECT a, SUBST a) => a -> c
      at T3208b.hs:14:9-56
    NB: `STerm' is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Expected type: STerm a0
      Actual type: OTerm a0
    In the expression: fce (apply f)
    In an equation for fce': fce' f = fce (apply f)
