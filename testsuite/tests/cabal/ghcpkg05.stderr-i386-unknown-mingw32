There are problems in package testpkg-2.0:
  Warning: library-dirs: c:/Program Files/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  Warning: include-dirs: c:/Program Files/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  import-dirs: /usr/local/lib/testpkg is a relative path which makes no sense (as there is nothing for it to be relative to). You can make paths relative to the package database itself by using ${pkgroot}.

The following packages are broken, either because they have a problem
listed above, or because they depend on a broken package.
testpkg-2.0
testpkg-3.0
ghc-pkg.exe: unregistering testpkg-2.0 would break the following packages: testpkg-3.0 (use --force to override)
