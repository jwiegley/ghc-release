    Could not deduce (Eq a) from the context (Eq (T a))
      arising from a use of `==' at drvfail011.hs:8:0-25
    Possible fix: add (Eq a) to the context of the instance declaration
    In the expression: ((a1 == b1))
    In the definition of `==': == (T1 a1) (T1 b1) = ((a1 == b1))
    When typechecking a standalone-derived method for `Eq (T a)':
      == (T1 a1) (T1 b1) = ((a1 == b1))
      == a b
           = case (ShouldFail.$con2tag_T a) of {
               a#
                 -> case (ShouldFail.$con2tag_T b) of {
                      b# -> (a# GHC.Prim.==# b#) } }
    In the instance declaration for `Eq (T a)'
