    Could not deduce (Eq a) from the context (Eq (T a))
      arising from a use of `==' at drvfail011.hs:8:0-25
    Possible fix: add (Eq a) to the context of the instance declaration
    In the expression: ((a1 == b1))
    In the definition of `==': == (T1 a1) (T1 b1) = ((a1 == b1))
    In the instance declaration for `Eq (T a)'
