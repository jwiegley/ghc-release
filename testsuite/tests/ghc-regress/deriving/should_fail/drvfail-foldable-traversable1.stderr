    No instance for (Functor Trivial1)
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
                   at drvfail-foldable-traversable1.hs:9:22-32
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Functor Trivial1)
      or use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration instead,
         so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Traversable Trivial1)
