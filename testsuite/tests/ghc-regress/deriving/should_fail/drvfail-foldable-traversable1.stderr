    No instance for (Functor Trivial1)
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Functor Trivial1)
    Alternatively, use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
      so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Traversable Trivial1)
