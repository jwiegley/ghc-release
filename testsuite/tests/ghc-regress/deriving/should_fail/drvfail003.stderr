    No instance for (Show (v (v a)))
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
                   at drvfail003.hs:16:55-58
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Show (v (v a)))
      or use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration instead,
         so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Show (Square_ v w a))
