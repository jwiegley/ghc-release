    Can't make a derived instance of `Functor InFunctionArgument':
      Constructor `InFunctionArgument' uses the type variable in a function argument
    In the newtype declaration for `InFunctionArgument'

    Can't make a derived instance of `Functor OnSecondArg':
      Constructor `OnSecondArg' uses the type variable in an argument other than the last
    In the newtype declaration for `OnSecondArg'

    Cannot derive well-kinded instance of form `Functor (NoArguments ...)'
      Class `Functor' expects an argument of kind `* -> *'
    In the newtype declaration for `NoArguments'

    Can't make a derived instance of `Functor StupidConstraint':
      Data type `StupidConstraint' has a class context (Eq a)
    In the data type declaration for `StupidConstraint'

drvfail-functor2.hs:26:14:
    No instance for (Functor NoFunctor)
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Functor NoFunctor)
    Alternatively, use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
      so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Functor UseNoFunctor)
