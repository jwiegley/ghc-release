    Couldn't match type `s' with `state'
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the instance declaration at T3621.hs:21:22
      `state' is a rigid type variable bound by
              the instance declaration at T3621.hs:21:22
    arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
    Alternatively, use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
      so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (MonadState state (WrappedState s))
