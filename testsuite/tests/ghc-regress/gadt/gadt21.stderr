gadt21.hs:21:59:
    Could not deduce (Ord a1) from the context (a ~ Set a1)
      arising from a use of `f' at gadt21.hs:21:59-61
    Possible fix:
      add (Ord a1) to the context of the constructor `TypeSet'
    In the first argument of `Just', namely `(f e)'
    In the expression: Just (f e)
    In the definition of `withOrdDynExpr':
        withOrdDynExpr (DynExpr (e@(Const (TypeSet _) _))) f = Just (f e)
