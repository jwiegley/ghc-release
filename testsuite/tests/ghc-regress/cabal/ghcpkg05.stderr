There are problems in package testpkg-2.0:
  import-dirs: /usr/local/lib/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  import-dirs: c:/Program Files/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  library-dirs: /usr/local/lib/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  library-dirs: c:/Program Files/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  file A.hi is missing
  file B.hi is missing
  file C/D.hi is missing
  file C/E.hi is missing
  cannot find libtestpkg-2.0.a on library path

The following packages are broken, either because they have a problem
listed above, or because they depend on a broken package.
testpkg-2.0
testpkg-3.0
ghc-pkg: unregistering testpkg-2.0 would break the following packages: testpkg-3.0 (use --force to override)
