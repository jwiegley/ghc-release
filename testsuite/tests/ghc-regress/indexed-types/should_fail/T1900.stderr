T1900.hs:11:12:
    No instance for (Num ())
      arising from the literal `1' at T1900.hs:11:12
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num ())
    In the second argument of `(+)', namely `1'
    In the expression: (+ 1)
    In the definition of `trans': trans = (+ 1)

T1900.hs:14:21:
    Couldn't match expected type `Depend s'
           against inferred type `Depend s1'
    In the first argument of `trans', namely `d'
    In the second argument of `(==)', namely `trans d'
    In the expression: d == trans d
