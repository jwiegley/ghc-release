    Could not deduce (Memo d ~ Memo d1) from the context (Fun d1)
    NB: `Memo' is a type function, and may not be injective
    Expected type: Memo d1 a
      Actual type: Memo d a
    In the first argument of `(.)', namely `abst'
    In the expression: abst . appl
    In an equation for `f': f = abst . appl
