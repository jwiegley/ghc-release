    Could not deduce (DoC (x (A2 (FCon x) -> A3 (FCon x))))
      from the context (Functor x, DoC (FCon x))
      arising from a use of `op'
    Possible fix:
      add (DoC (x (A2 (FCon x) -> A3 (FCon x)))) to the context of
        the type signature for `fCon'
      or add an instance declaration for
         (DoC (x (A2 (FCon x) -> A3 (FCon x))))
    In the first argument of `foldDoC', namely `op'
    In the expression: foldDoC op
    In an equation for `fCon': fCon = foldDoC op
