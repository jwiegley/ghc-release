    Couldn't match type `ix' with `r0 ix0 -> Writer [AnyF s0] (r0 ix0)'
      `ix' is a rigid type variable bound by
           the type signature for children :: s ix -> PF s r ix -> [AnyF s]
           at T3330a.hs:17:1
    Expected type: PF s r (r0 ix0 -> Writer [AnyF s0] (r0 ix0))
      Actual type: PF s r ix
    In the third argument of `hmapM', namely `x'
    In the first argument of `execWriter', namely `(hmapM p collect x)'
    In the expression: execWriter (hmapM p collect x)
