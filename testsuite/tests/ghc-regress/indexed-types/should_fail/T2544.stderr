    Could not deduce (IxMap l ~ IxMap i0)
    from the context (Ix l, Ix r)
      bound by the instance declaration at T2544.hs:13:10-37
    NB: `IxMap' is a type function, and may not be injective
    Expected type: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int]
      Actual type: BiApp (IxMap i0) (IxMap r) [Int]
    In the return type of a call of `BiApp'
    In the expression: BiApp empty empty
    In an equation for `empty': empty = BiApp empty empty
