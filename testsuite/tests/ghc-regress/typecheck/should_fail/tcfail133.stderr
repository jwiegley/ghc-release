tcfail133.hs:68:13:
    No instance for (AddDigit (Zero :@ (One :@ One)) One a)
      arising from a use of `add' at tcfail133.hs:68:13-38
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for
      (AddDigit (Zero :@ (One :@ One)) One a)
    In the second argument of `($)', namely
	`add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)'
    In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
    In the definition of `foo':
	foo = show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
