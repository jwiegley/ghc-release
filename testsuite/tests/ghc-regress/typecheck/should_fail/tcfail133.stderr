    No instance for (AddDigit (Zero :@ (One :@ One)) One c)
      arising from a use of `add'
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for
      (AddDigit (Zero :@ (One :@ One)) One c)
    In the second argument of `($)', namely
        `add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)'
    In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
    In an equation for `foo':
        foo = show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
