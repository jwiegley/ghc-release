    Generic method type is too complex
        match :: forall k.
                 ChurchEncode k =>
                 forall z.
                 k

                 -> (forall a z. a -> z)
                 -> z
        You can only use type variables, arrows, lists, and tuples
    When checking the class method:
      match :: k
               -> z
               -> (forall a b z. a -> b -> z)
               -> (forall a z. a -> z)
               -> (forall a z. a -> z)
               -> z
