    Could not deduce (C [a], B [a]) from the context ()
      arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration
                   at tcfail019.hs:18:9-13
    Possible fix:
      add (C [a], B [a]) to the context of the instance declaration
      or add an instance declaration for (C [a], B [a])
    In the instance declaration for `D [a]'
