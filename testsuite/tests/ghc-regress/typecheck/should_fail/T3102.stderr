    Couldn't match expected type `a1'
           against inferred type `(?p::Int) => a'
      `a1' is a rigid type variable bound by
           the polymorphic type `forall a1. a1 -> String' at T3102.hs:11:9
    In the first argument of `f', namely `t'
    In the expression: f t
    In the definition of `result': result = f t
