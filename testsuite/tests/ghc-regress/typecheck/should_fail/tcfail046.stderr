    No instance for (Eq (Process a))
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
                   at tcfail046.hs:9:47-48
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Eq (Process a))
      or use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration instead,
         so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Eq (Continuation a))
