    Couldn't match expected type `x' against inferred type `x1'
      `x' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the instance declaration at tcfail065.hs:28:17
      `x1' is a rigid type variable bound by
           the type signature for `setX' at tcfail065.hs:25:10
    In the first argument of `X', namely `x'
    In the expression: X x
    In the definition of `setX': setX x (X _) = X x
