    Could not deduce (Integral (Ratio a)) from the context (Integral a)
      arising from a use of `p'
    Possible fix:
      add (Integral (Ratio a)) to the context of
        the type signature for `f'
      or add an instance declaration for (Integral (Ratio a))
    In the `p' field of a record
    In the expression: x {p = p x}
    In an equation for `f': f x = x {p = p x}
