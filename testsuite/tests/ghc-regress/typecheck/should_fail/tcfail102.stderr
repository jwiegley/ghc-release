    Could not deduce (Integral (Ratio a)) arising from a record update
    from the context (Integral a)
      bound by the type signature for
                 f :: Integral a => P (Ratio a) -> P (Ratio a)
      at tcfail102.hs:8:1-19
    Possible fix:
      add (Integral (Ratio a)) to the context of
        the type signature for
          f :: Integral a => P (Ratio a) -> P (Ratio a)
      or add an instance declaration for (Integral (Ratio a))
    In the expression: x {p = p x}
    In an equation for `f': f x = x {p = p x}
