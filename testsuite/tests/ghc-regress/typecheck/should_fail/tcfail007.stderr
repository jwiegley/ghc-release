tcfail007.hs:3:15:
    No instance for (Num Bool)
      arising from the literal `1' at tcfail007.hs:3:15
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num Bool)
    In the second argument of `(+)', namely `1'
    In the expression: x + 1
    In the definition of `n':
	n x | True = x + 1
	    | False = True
