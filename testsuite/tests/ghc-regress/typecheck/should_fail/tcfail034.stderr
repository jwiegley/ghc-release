    Could not deduce (Integral a) from the context (Num a, Eq a)
      arising from a use of `mod'
    Possible fix:
      add (Integral a) to the context of the type signature for `test'
    In the first argument of `(==)', namely `(x `mod` 3)'
    In the expression: (x `mod` 3) == 0
    In an equation for `test': test x = (x `mod` 3) == 0
