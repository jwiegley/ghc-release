    Couldn't match type `a' with `HsDoc id'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for `gfoldl'' at tcfail201.hs:15:78
    In the pattern: DocEmpty
    In a case alternative: DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
    In the expression:
        case hsDoc of {
          DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
          (DocParagraph hsDoc) -> z DocParagraph `k` hsDoc }
