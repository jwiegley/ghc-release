tcfail190.hs:11:8:
    No instance for (Ord Unorderable)
      arising from a use of `GHC.Exts.groupWith' at tcfail190.hs:11:8
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Ord Unorderable)
    In the expression: GHC.Exts.groupWith
    In a stmt of a list comprehension:
        x <- [Gnorf, Brain] then group by x
    In the expression: [() | x <- [Gnorf, Brain] then group by x]
