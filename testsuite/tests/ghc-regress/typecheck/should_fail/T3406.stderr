
T3406.hs:11:5:
    The type variables `a, b'
    should be bound by the pattern signature `ItemColID a b'
    but are actually discarded by a type synonym
    To fix this, expand the type synonym
    [Note: I hope to lift this restriction in due course]
    In the pattern: x :: ItemColID a b
    In the definition of `get':
        get (x :: ItemColID a b) = x :: ItemColID a b
