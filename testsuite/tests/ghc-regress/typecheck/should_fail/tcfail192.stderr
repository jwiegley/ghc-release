    No instance for (Num [[Char]])
      arising from the literal `1'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [[Char]])
    In the second argument of `(+)', namely `1'
    In the expression: x + 1
    In the expression:
      [x + 1 | x <- ["Hello", "World"], then group using take 5]

tcfail192.hs:10:26:
    Couldn't match type `a' with `[a]'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          a type expected by the context: [a] -> [[a]] at tcfail192.hs:10:9
    Expected type: [a] -> [[a]]
      Actual type: [a] -> [a]
    In the return type of a call of `take'
    In the expression: take 5
