    All of the type variables in the constraint `Show a'
    are already in scope (at least one must be universally quantified here)
	(Use -XFlexibleContexts to lift this restriction)
    When checking the class method:
      op :: forall b. (Show a, Show b) => a -> b -> String
    In the class declaration for `C'
