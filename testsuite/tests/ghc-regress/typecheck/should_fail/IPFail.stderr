    Could not deduce (Num Bool) from the context (?x::Int)
      arising from the literal `5'
    Possible fix:
      add (Num Bool) to the context of the type signature for `f0'
      or add an instance declaration for (Num Bool)
    In the expression: 5
    In the expression: let ?x = 5 in ?x
    In an equation for `f0': f0 () = let ?x = 5 in ?x
