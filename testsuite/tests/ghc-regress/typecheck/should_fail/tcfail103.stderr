    Couldn't match expected type `s' against inferred type `t'
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
	  the type signature for `g' at tcfail103.hs:13:16
      `t' is a rigid type variable bound by
	  the type signature for `f' at tcfail103.hs:10:7
      Expected type: STRef s Int
      Inferred type: STRef t Int
    In the first argument of `readSTRef', namely `v'
    In the expression: readSTRef v
