tcfail043.hs:38:17:
    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
      (Ord_ a) arising from a use of `gt'
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      search :: a -> [a] -> Bool (bound at tcfail043.hs:37:1)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
                  or use -XNoMonomorphismRestriction
    In the expression: gt (hd bs) a
    In the expression:
        if gt (hd bs) a then
            False
        else
            if eq a (hd bs) then True else search a (tl bs)
    In the expression:
        \ a bs
            -> if gt (hd bs) a then
                   False
               else
                   if eq a (hd bs) then True else search a (tl bs)
