tcfail171.hs:9:9:
    Could not deduce (PrintfArg a, PrintfType b) from the context ()
      arising from a use of `printf' at tcfail171.hs:9:9-23
    Possible fix:
      add (PrintfArg a, PrintfType b) to the context of
        the type signature for `phex'
    In the expression: printf "0x%x" x
    In the definition of `phex': phex x = printf "0x%x" x
