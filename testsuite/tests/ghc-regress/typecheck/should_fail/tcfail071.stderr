    Contexts differ in length
      (Use -XRelaxedPolyRec to allow this)
    When matching the contexts of the signatures for
      f :: forall d. (Ord d) => d -> d
      g :: forall e. e -> e
    The signature contexts in a mutually recursive group should all be identical
    When generalising the type(s) for f, g
