    Warning: Inventing strangely-kinded Any TyCon
               of kind `(* -> *) -> * -> *'
               from an instantiation of type variable `f'
             This warning can be suppressed by a type signature fixing `f'
               but is harmless without -O (and usually harmless anyway).
             See http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/959 for details

<no location info>:
Failing due to -Werror.
