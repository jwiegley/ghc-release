    Could not deduce (A [a]) from the context (A a)
      arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration
                   at tcfail020.hs:10:9-22
    Possible fix:
      add (A [a]) to the context of the instance declaration
      or add an instance declaration for (A [a])
    In the instance declaration for `B [a]'
