    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
      (Foo a) arising from a use of `foo'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: foo
    In the expression: proc x -> case x of { Bar a -> foo -< a }
    In an equation for `get':
        get = proc x -> case x of { Bar a -> foo -< a }
