    Couldn't match type `[a0]' with `a -> a1'
    Expected type: (a -> a1) -> [a] -> t0 [a]
      Actual type: [a0] -> [a0]
    In the return type of a call of `take'
    Probable cause: `take' is applied to too many arguments
    In the expression: take 2
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then group by x using take 2
