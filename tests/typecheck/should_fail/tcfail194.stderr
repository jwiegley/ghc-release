    Couldn't match type `[a0]' with `a -> t0'
    Expected type: (a -> t0) -> [a] -> [a]
      Actual type: [a0] -> [a0]
    In the return type of a call of `take'
    Probable cause: `take' is applied to too many arguments
    In the expression: take 5
    In a stmt of a list comprehension: then take 5 by x
