ExtraTcsUntch.hs:23:53:
    Could not deduce (C [t] [a]) arising from a use of `op'
    from the context (beta ~ [t], F Int ~ [[t]])
      bound by the inferred type of
               f :: (beta ~ [t], F Int ~ [[t]]) => beta -> ((), ((), ()))
      at ExtraTcsUntch.hs:(20,1)-(24,29)
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (C [t] [a])
    In the expression: op x [y]
    In the expression: (h [[undefined]], op x [y])
    In a case alternative: TEx y -> (h [[undefined]], op x [y])
