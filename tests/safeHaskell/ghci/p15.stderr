    Can't create hand written instances of Typeable in Safe Haskell! Can only derive them

<interactive>:22:22:
    No instance for (Typeable G) arising from a use of `cast'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Typeable G)
    In the expression: (cast y) :: Maybe H
    In a pattern binding: (Just y_as_H) = (cast y) :: Maybe H

<interactive>:23:1: Not in scope: `y_as_H'
