simplifyBracket is used when simplifying the constraints arising from
a Template Haskell bracket [| ... |].  We want to check that there aren't
any constraints that can't be satisfied (e.g. Show Foo, where Foo has no
Show instance), but we aren't otherwise interested in the results.
Nor do we care about ambiguous dictionaries etc.  We will type check
this bracket again at its usage site.

Note [Exotic derived instance contexts]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In a 'derived' instance declaration, we *infer* the context.  It's a
bit unclear what rules we should apply for this; the Haskell report is
silent.  Obviously, constraints like (Eq a) are fine, but what about
	data T f a = MkT (f a) deriving( Eq )
where we'd get an Eq (f a) constraint.  That's probably fine too.

One could go further: consider
	data T a b c = MkT (Foo a b c) deriving( Eq )
	instance (C Int a, Eq b, Eq c) => Eq (Foo a b c)

Notice that this instance (just) satisfies the Paterson termination 
conditions.  Then we *could* derive an instance decl like this:

	instance (C Int a, Eq b, Eq c) => Eq (T a b c) 
even though there is no instance for (C Int a), because there just
*might* be an instance for, say, (C Int Bool) at a site where we
need the equality instance for T's.  

However, this seems pretty exotic, and it's quite tricky to allow
this, and yet give sensible error messages in the (much more common)
case where we really want that instance decl for C.

So for now we simply require that the derived instance context
should have only type-variable constraints.

Here is another example:
	data Fix f = In (f (Fix f)) deriving( Eq )
Here, if we are prepared to allow -XUndecidableInstances we
could derive the instance
	instance Eq (f (Fix f)) => Eq (Fix f)
but this is so delicate that I don't think it should happen inside
'deriving'. If you want this, write it yourself!

NB: if you want to lift this condition, make sure you still meet the
termination conditions!  If not, the deriving mechanism generates
larger and larger constraints.  Example:
  data Succ a = S a
  data Seq a = Cons a (Seq (Succ a)) | Nil deriving Show

Note the lack of a Show instance for Succ.  First we'll generate
  instance (Show (Succ a), Show a) => Show (Seq a)
and then
  instance (Show (Succ (Succ a)), Show (Succ a), Show a) => Show (Seq a)
and so on.  Instead we want to complain of no instance for (Show (Succ a)).

The bottom line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Allow constraints which consist only of type variables, with no repeats.

Note [Avoid unecessary constraint simplification]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When inferring the type of a let-binding, with simplifyInfer,
try to avoid unnecessariliy simplifying class constraints.
Doing so aids sharing, but it also helps with delicate 
situations like
   instance C t => C [t] where ..
   f :: C [t] => ....
   f x = let g y = ...(constraint C [t])... 
         in ...
When inferring a type for 'g', we don't want to apply the
instance decl, because then we can't satisfy (C t).  So we
just notice that g isn't quantified over 't' and partition
the contraints before simplifying.

This only half-works, but then let-generalisation only half-works.


Note [Inheriting implicit parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this:

	f x = (x::Int) + ?y

where f is *not* a top-level binding.
From the RHS of f we'll get the constraint (?y::Int).
There are two types we might infer for f:

	f :: Int -> Int

(so we get ?y from the context of f's definition), or

	f :: (?y::Int) => Int -> Int

At first you might think the first was better, becuase then
?y behaves like a free variable of the definition, rather than
having to be passed at each call site.  But of course, the WHOLE
IDEA is that ?y should be passed at each call site (that's what
dynamic binding means) so we'd better infer the second.

BOTTOM LINE: when *inferring types* you *must* quantify 
over implicit parameters. See the predicate isFreeWhenInferring.

***********************************************************************************

When constructing evidence for superclasses in an instance declaration, 
  * we MUST have the "self" dictionary available, but
  * we must NOT have its superclasses derived from "self"

Moreover, we must *completely* solve the constraints right now,
not wrap them in an implication constraint to solve later.  Why?
Because when that implication constraint is solved there may
be some unrelated other solved top-level constraints that
recursively depend on the superclass we are building. Consider
   class Ord a => C a where
   instance C [Int] where ...
Then we get
   dCListInt :: C [Int]
   dCListInt = MkC $cNum ...

   $cNum :: Ord [Int] -- The superclass
   $cNum = let self = dCListInt in <solve Ord [Int]>

Now, if there is some *other* top-level constraint solved
looking like
	foo :: Ord [Int]
        foo = scsel dCInt
we must not solve the (Ord [Int]) wanted from foo!!

Note [Simplifying RULE lhs constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the LHS of transformation rules we only simplify only equalitis,
but not dictionaries.  We want to keep dictionaries unsimplified, to
serve as the available stuff for the RHS of the rule.  We *do* want to
simplify equalities, however, to detect ill-typed rules that cannot be
applied.

Implementation: the TcSFlags carried by the TcSMonad controls the
amount of simplification, so simplifyRuleLhs just sets the flag
appropriately.

Example.  Consider the following left-hand side of a rule
	f (x == y) (y > z) = ...
If we typecheck this expression we get constraints
	d1 :: Ord a, d2 :: Eq a
We do NOT want to "simplify" to the LHS
	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Ord a.
	  f ((==) (eqFromOrd d1) x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...
Instead we want	
	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Ord a, d2::Eq a.
	  f ((==) d2 x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...

Here is another example:
	fromIntegral :: (Integral a, Num b) => a -> b
	{-# RULES "foo"  fromIntegral = id :: Int -> Int #-}
In the rule, a=b=Int, and Num Int is a superclass of Integral Int. But
we *dont* want to get
	forall dIntegralInt.
	   fromIntegral Int Int dIntegralInt (scsel dIntegralInt) = id Int
because the scsel will mess up RULE matching.  Instead we want
	forall dIntegralInt, dNumInt.
	  fromIntegral Int Int dIntegralInt dNumInt = id Int

Even if we have 
	g (x == y) (y == z) = ..
where the two dictionaries are *identical*, we do NOT WANT
	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Eq a
	  f ((==) d1 x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...
because that will only match if the dict args are (visibly) equal.
Instead we want to quantify over the dictionaries separately.

In short, simplifyRuleLhs must *only* squash equalities, leaving
all dicts unchanged, with absolutely no sharing.  

HOWEVER, under a nested implication things are different
Consider
  f :: (forall a. Eq a => a->a) -> Bool -> ...
  {-# RULES "foo" forall (v::forall b. Eq b => b->b).
       f b True = ...
    #=}
Here we *must* solve the wanted (Eq a) from the given (Eq a)
resulting from skolemising the agument type of g.  So we 
revert to SimplCheck when going under an implication.

Note [Float Equalities out of Implications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
We want to float equalities out of vanilla existentials, but *not* out 
of GADT pattern matches. 

Note [Preparing inert set for implications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before solving the nested implications, we convert any unsolved flat wanteds
to givens, and add them to the inert set.  Reasons:
  a) In checking mode, suppresses unnecessary errors.  We already have 
     on unsolved-wanted error; adding it to the givens prevents any 
     consequential errors from showing uop
  b) More importantly, in inference mode, we are going to quantify over this
     constraint, and we *don't* want to quantify over any constraints that
     are deducible from it.

The unsolved wanteds are *canonical* but they may not be *inert*,
because when made into a given they might interact with other givens.
Hence the call to solveInteract.  Example:

 Original inert set = (d :_g D a) /\ (co :_w  a ~ [beta]) 

We were not able to solve (a ~w [beta]) but we can't just assume it as
given because the resulting set is not inert. Hence we have to do a
'solveInteract' step first

Note [Solving Family Equations] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
After we are done with simplification we may be left with constraints of the form:
     [Wanted] F xis ~ beta 
If 'beta' is a touchable unification variable not already bound in the TyBinds 
then we'd like to create a binding for it, effectively "defaulting" it to be 'F xis'.

When is it ok to do so? 
    1) 'beta' must not already be defaulted to something. Example: 

           [Wanted] F Int  ~ beta   <~ Will default [beta := F Int]
           [Wanted] F Char ~ beta   <~ Already defaulted, can't default again. We 
                                       have to report this as unsolved.

    2) However, we must still do an occurs check when defaulting (F xis ~ beta), to 
       set [beta := F xis] only if beta is not among the free variables of xis.

    3) Notice that 'beta' can't be bound in ty binds already because we rewrite RHS 
       of type family equations. See Inert Set invariants in TcInteract.

Basic plan behind applyDefaulting rules: 
 
 Step 1:  
    Split wanteds into defaultable groups, `groups' and the rest `rest_wanted' 
    For each defaultable group, do: 
      For each possible substitution for [alpha |-> tau] where `alpha' is the 
      group's variable, do: 
        1) Make up new TcEvBinds
        2) Extend TcS with (groupVariable 
        3) given_inert <- solveOne inert (given : a ~ tau) 
        4) (final_inert,unsolved) <- solveWanted (given_inert) (group_constraints)
        5) if unsolved == empty then 
                 sneakyUnify a |-> tau 
                 write the evidence bins
                 return (final_inert ++ group_constraints,[]) 
                      -- will contain the info (alpha |-> tau)!!
                 goto next defaultable group 
           if unsolved <> empty then 
                 throw away evidence binds
                 try next substitution 
     If you've run out of substitutions for this group, too bad, you failed 
                 return (inert,group) 
                 goto next defaultable group
 
 Step 2: 
   Collect all the (canonical-cts, wanteds) gathered this way. 
   - Do a solveGiven over the canonical-cts to make sure they are inert

Note [Avoiding spurious errors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When doing the unification for defaulting, we check for skolem
type variables, and simply don't default them.  For example:
   f = (*)	-- Monomorphic
   g :: Num a => a -> a
   g x = f x x
Here, we get a complaint when checking the type signature for g,
that g isn't polymorphic enough; but then we get another one when
dealing with the (Num a) context arising from f's definition;
we try to unify a with Int (to default it), but find that it's
already been unified with the rigid variable from g's type sig
