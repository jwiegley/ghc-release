Note [InertSet invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An InertSet is a bag of canonical constraints, with the following invariants:

  1 No two constraints react with each other. 
    
    A tricky case is when there exists a given (solved) dictionary 
    constraint and a wanted identical constraint in the inert set, but do 
    not react because reaction would create loopy dictionary evidence for 
    the wanted. See note [Recursive dictionaries]

  2 Given equalities form an idempotent substitution [none of the
    given LHS's occur in any of the given RHS's or reactant parts]

  3 Wanted equalities also form an idempotent substitution

  4 The entire set of equalities is acyclic.

  5 Wanted dictionaries are inert with the top-level axiom set 

  6 Equalities of the form tv1 ~ tv2 always have a touchable variable
    on the left (if possible).

  7 No wanted constraints tv1 ~ tv2 with tv1 touchable. Such constraints
    will be marked as solved right before being pushed into the inert set. 
    See note [Touchables and givens].

  8 No Given constraint mentions a touchable unification variable,
    except if the
 
Note that 6 and 7 are /not/ enforced by canonicalization but rather by 
insertion in the inert list, ie by TcInteract. 

During the process of solving, the inert set will contain some
previously given constraints, some wanted constraints, and some given
constraints which have arisen from solving wanted constraints. For
now we do not distinguish between given and solved constraints.

Note that we must switch wanted inert items to given when going under an
implication constraint (when in top-level inference mode).

Note [Touchables and givens]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Touchable variables will never show up in givens which are inputs to
the solver.  However, touchables may show up in givens generated by the flattener.  
For example,

  axioms:
    G Int ~ Char
    F Char ~ Int

  wanted:
    F (G alpha) ~w Int
  
canonicalises to

  G alpha ~g b
  F b ~w Int

which can be put in the inert set.  Suppose we also have a wanted

  alpha ~w Int

We cannot rewrite the given G alpha ~g b using the wanted alpha ~w
Int.  Instead, after reacting alpha ~w Int with the whole inert set,
we observe that we can solve it by unifying alpha with Int, so we mark
it as solved and put it back in the *work list*. [We also immediately unify
alpha := Int, without telling anyone, see trySpontaneousSolve function, to 
avoid doing this in the end.]

Later, because it is solved (given, in effect), we can use it to rewrite 
G alpha ~g b to G Int ~g b, which gets put back in the work list. Eventually, 
we will dispatch the remaining wanted constraints using the top-level axioms.

Finally, note that after reacting a wanted equality with the entire inert set
we may end up with something like

  b ~w alpha

which we should flip around to generate the solved constraint alpha ~s b.

Note [Efficient Orientation] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two cases where we have to be careful about 
orienting equalities to get better efficiency. 

Case 1: In Rewriting Equalities (function rewriteEqLHS) 

    When rewriting two equalities with the same LHS:
          (a)  (tv ~ xi1) 
          (b)  (tv ~ xi2) 
    We have a choice of producing work (xi1 ~ xi2) (up-to the
    canonicalization invariants) However, to prevent the inert items
    from getting kicked out of the inerts first, we prefer to
    canonicalize (xi1 ~ xi2) if (b) comes from the inert set, or (xi2
    ~ xi1) if (a) comes from the inert set.
    
    This choice is implemented using the WhichComesFromInert flag. 

Case 2: Functional Dependencies 
    Again, we should prefer, if possible, the inert variables on the RHS

Case 3: IP improvement work
    We must always rewrite so that the inert type is on the right.

Note [Kind errors] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the wanted problem: 
      alpha ~ (# Int, Int #) 
where alpha :: ?? and (# Int, Int #) :: (#). We can't spontaneously solve this constraint, 
but we should rather reject the program that give rise to it. If 'trySpontaneousEqTwoWay' 
simply returns @CantSolve@ then that wanted constraint is going to propagate all the way and 
get quantified over in inference mode. That's bad because we do know at this point that the 
constraint is insoluble. Instead, we call 'recKindErrorTcS' here, which will fail later on.

The same applies in canonicalization code in case of kind errors in the givens. 

However, when we canonicalize givens we only check for compatibility (@compatKind@). 
If there were a kind error in the givens, this means some form of inconsistency or dead code.

You may think that when we spontaneously solve wanteds we may have to look through the 
bindings to determine the right kind of the RHS type. E.g one may be worried that xi is 
@alpha@ where alpha :: ? and a previous spontaneous solving has set (alpha := f) with (f :: *).
But we orient our constraints so that spontaneously solved ones can rewrite all other constraint
so this situation can't happen. 

Note [Spontaneous solving and kind compatibility] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that our canonical constraints insist that only *given* equalities (tv ~ xi) 
or (F xis ~ rhs) require the LHS and the RHS to have exactly the same kinds. 

  - We have to require this because: 
        Given equalities can be freely used to rewrite inside 
        other types or constraints.
  - We do not have to do the same for wanteds because:
        First, wanted equations (tv ~ xi) where tv is a touchable
        unification variable may have kinds that do not agree (the
        kind of xi must be a sub kind of the kind of tv).  Second, any
        potential kind mismatch will result in the constraint not
        being soluble, which will be reported anyway. This is the
        reason that @trySpontaneousOneWay@ and @trySpontaneousTwoWay@
        will perform a kind compatibility check, and only then will
        they proceed to @solveWithIdentity@.

Caveat: 
  - Givens from higher-rank, such as: 
          type family T b :: * -> * -> * 
          type instance T Bool = (->) 

          f :: forall a. ((T a ~ (->)) => ...) -> a -> ... 
          flop = f (...) True 
     Whereas we would be able to apply the type instance, we would not be able to 
     use the given (T Bool ~ (->)) in the body of 'flop' 


Note [Avoid double unifications] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The spontaneous solver has to return a given which mentions the unified unification
variable *on the left* of the equality. Here is what happens if not: 
  Original wanted:  (a ~ alpha),  (alpha ~ Int) 
We spontaneously solve the first wanted, without changing the order! 
      given : a ~ alpha      [having unified alpha := a] 
Now the second wanted comes along, but he cannot rewrite the given, so we simply continue.
At the end we spontaneously solve that guy, *reunifying*  [alpha := Int] 

We avoid this problem by orienting the resulting given so that the unification
variable is on the left.  [Note that alternatively we could attempt to
enforce this at canonicalization]

See also Note [No touchables as FunEq RHS] in TcSMonad; avoiding
double unifications is the main reason we disallow touchable
unification variables as RHS of type family equations: F xis ~ alpha.

Note [Superclasses and recursive dictionaries]

                  Note [Recursive instances and superclases]
    ToDo: check overlap and delete redundant stuff

Right before adding a given into the inert set, we must
produce some more work, that will bring the superclasses 
of the given into scope. The superclass constraints go into 
our worklist. 

When we simplify a wanted constraint, if we first see a matching
instance, we may produce new wanted work. To (1) avoid doing this work 
twice in the future and (2) to handle recursive dictionaries we may ``cache'' 
this item as solved (in effect, given) into our inert set and with that add 
its superclass constraints (as given) in our worklist. 

But now we have added partially solved constraints to the worklist which may 
interact with other wanteds. Consider the example: 

Example 1: 

    class Eq b => Foo a b        --- 0-th selector
    instance Eq a => Foo [a] a   --- fooDFun

and wanted (Foo [t] t). We are first going to see that the instance matches 
and create an inert set that includes the solved (Foo [t] t) and its 
superclasses. 
       d1 :_g Foo [t] t                 d1 := EvDFunApp fooDFun d3 
       d2 :_g Eq t                      d2 := EvSuperClass d1 0 
Our work list is going to contain a new *wanted* goal
       d3 :_w Eq t 
It is wrong to react the wanted (Eq t) with the given (Eq t) because that would 
construct loopy evidence. Hence the check isGoodRecEv in doInteractWithInert. 

OK, so we have ruled out bad behaviour, but how do we ge recursive dictionaries, 
at all? Consider

Example 2:

    data D r = ZeroD | SuccD (r (D r));
    
    instance (Eq (r (D r))) => Eq (D r) where
        ZeroD     == ZeroD     = True
        (SuccD a) == (SuccD b) = a == b
        _         == _         = False;
    
    equalDC :: D [] -> D [] -> Bool;
    equalDC = (==);

We need to prove (Eq (D [])). Here's how we go:

	d1 :_w Eq (D [])

by instance decl, holds if
	d2 :_w Eq [D []]
	where 	d1 = dfEqD d2

*BUT* we have an inert set which gives us (no superclasses): 
        d1 :_g Eq (D []) 
By the instance declaration of Eq we can show the 'd2' goal if 
	d3 :_w Eq (D [])
	where	d2 = dfEqList d3
		d1 = dfEqD d2
Now, however this wanted can interact with our inert d1 to set: 
        d3 := d1 
and solve the goal. Why was this interaction OK? Because, if we chase the 
evidence of d1 ~~> dfEqD d2 ~~-> dfEqList d3, so by setting d3 := d1 we 
are really setting
        d3 := dfEqD2 (dfEqList d3) 
which is FINE because the use of d3 is protected by the instance function 
applications. 

So, our strategy is to try to put solved wanted dictionaries into the
inert set along with their superclasses (when this is meaningful,
i.e. when new wanted goals are generated) but solve a wanted dictionary
from a given only in the case where the evidence variable of the
wanted is mentioned in the evidence of the given (recursively through
the evidence binds) in a protected way: more instance function applications 
than superclass selectors.

Here are some more examples from GHC's previous type checker


Example 3: 
This code arises in the context of "Scrap Your Boilerplate with Class"

    class Sat a
    class Data ctx a
    instance  Sat (ctx Char)             => Data ctx Char       -- dfunData1
    instance (Sat (ctx [a]), Data ctx a) => Data ctx [a]        -- dfunData2

    class Data Maybe a => Foo a    

    instance Foo t => Sat (Maybe t)                             -- dfunSat

    instance Data Maybe a => Foo a                              -- dfunFoo1
    instance Foo a        => Foo [a]                            -- dfunFoo2
    instance                 Foo [Char]                         -- dfunFoo3

Consider generating the superclasses of the instance declaration
	 instance Foo a => Foo [a]

So our problem is this
    d0 :_g Foo t
    d1 :_w Data Maybe [t] 

We may add the given in the inert set, along with its superclasses
[assuming we don't fail because there is a matching instance, see 
 tryTopReact, given case ]
  Inert:
    d0 :_g Foo t 
  WorkList 
    d01 :_g Data Maybe t  -- d2 := EvDictSuperClass d0 0 
    d1 :_w Data Maybe [t] 
Then d2 can readily enter the inert, and we also do solving of the wanted
  Inert: 
    d0 :_g Foo t 
    d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
  WorkList
    d2 :_w Sat (Maybe [t])          
    d3 :_w Data Maybe t
    d01 :_g Data Maybe t 
Now, we may simplify d2 more: 
  Inert:
      d0 :_g Foo t 
      d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
      d1 :_g Data Maybe [t] 
      d2 :_g Sat (Maybe [t])          d2 := dfunSat d4 
  WorkList: 
      d3 :_w Data Maybe t 
      d4 :_w Foo [t] 
      d01 :_g Data Maybe t 

Now, we can just solve d3.
  Inert
      d0 :_g Foo t 
      d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
      d2 :_g Sat (Maybe [t])          d2 := dfunSat d4 
  WorkList
      d4 :_w Foo [t] 
      d01 :_g Data Maybe t 
And now we can simplify d4 again, but since it has superclasses we *add* them to the worklist:
  Inert
      d0 :_g Foo t 
      d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
      d2 :_g Sat (Maybe [t])          d2 := dfunSat d4 
      d4 :_g Foo [t]                  d4 := dfunFoo2 d5 
  WorkList:
      d5 :_w Foo t 
      d6 :_g Data Maybe [t]           d6 := EvDictSuperClass d4 0
      d01 :_g Data Maybe t 
Now, d5 can be solved! (and its superclass enter scope) 
  Inert
      d0 :_g Foo t 
      d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
      d2 :_g Sat (Maybe [t])          d2 := dfunSat d4 
      d4 :_g Foo [t]                  d4 := dfunFoo2 d5 
      d5 :_g Foo t                    d5 := dfunFoo1 d7
  WorkList:
      d7 :_w Data Maybe t
      d6 :_g Data Maybe [t]
      d8 :_g Data Maybe t            d8 := EvDictSuperClass d5 0
      d01 :_g Data Maybe t 

Now, two problems: 
   [1] Suppose we pick d8 and we react him with d01. Which of the two givens should 
       we keep? Well, we *MUST NOT* drop d01 because d8 contains recursive evidence 
       that must not be used (look at case interactInert where both inert and workitem
       are givens). So we have several options: 
       - Drop the workitem always (this will drop d8)
              This feels very unsafe -- what if the work item was the "good" one
              that should be used later to solve another wanted?
       - Don't drop anyone: the inert set may contain multiple givens! 
              [This is currently implemented] 

The "don't drop anyone" seems the most safe thing to do, so now we come to problem 2: 
  [2] We have added both d6 and d01 in the inert set, and we are interacting our wanted
      d7. Now the [isRecDictEv] function in the ineration solver 
      [case inert-given workitem-wanted] will prevent us from interacting d7 := d8 
      precisely because chasing the evidence of d8 leads us to an unguarded use of d7. 

      So, no interaction happens there. Then we meet d01 and there is no recursion 
      problem there [isRectDictEv] gives us the OK to interact and we do solve d7 := d01! 
             
Note [SUPERCLASS-LOOP 1]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have to be very, very careful when generating superclasses, lest we
accidentally build a loop. Here's an example:

  class S a

  class S a => C a where { opc :: a -> a }
  class S b => D b where { opd :: b -> b }
  
  instance C Int where
     opc = opd
  
  instance D Int where
     opd = opc

From (instance C Int) we get the constraint set {ds1:S Int, dd:D Int}
Simplifying, we may well get:
	$dfCInt = :C ds1 (opd dd)
	dd  = $dfDInt
	ds1 = $p1 dd
Notice that we spot that we can extract ds1 from dd.  

Alas!  Alack! We can do the same for (instance D Int):

	$dfDInt = :D ds2 (opc dc)
	dc  = $dfCInt
	ds2 = $p1 dc

And now we've defined the superclass in terms of itself.
Two more nasty cases are in
	tcrun021
	tcrun033

Solution: 
  - Satisfy the superclass context *all by itself* 
    (tcSimplifySuperClasses)
  - And do so completely; i.e. no left-over constraints
    to mix with the constraints arising from method declarations


Note [SUPERCLASS-LOOP 2]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to be careful when adding "the constaint we are trying to prove".
Suppose we are *given* d1:Ord a, and want to deduce (d2:C [a]) where

	class Ord a => C a where
	instance Ord [a] => C [a] where ...

Then we'll use the instance decl to deduce C [a] from Ord [a], and then add the
superclasses of C [a] to avails.  But we must not overwrite the binding
for Ord [a] (which is obtained from Ord a) with a superclass selection or we'll just
build a loop! 

Here's another variant, immortalised in tcrun020
	class Monad m => C1 m
	class C1 m => C2 m x
	instance C2 Maybe Bool
For the instance decl we need to build (C1 Maybe), and it's no good if
we run around and add (C2 Maybe Bool) and its superclasses to the avails 
before we search for C1 Maybe.

Here's another example 
 	class Eq b => Foo a b
	instance Eq a => Foo [a] a
If we are reducing
	(Foo [t] t)

we'll first deduce that it holds (via the instance decl).  We must not
then overwrite the Eq t constraint with a superclass selection!

At first I had a gross hack, whereby I simply did not add superclass constraints
in addWanted, though I did for addGiven and addIrred.  This was sub-optimal,
becuase it lost legitimate superclass sharing, and it still didn't do the job:
I found a very obscure program (now tcrun021) in which improvement meant the
simplifier got two bites a the cherry... so something seemed to be an Stop
first time, but reducible next time.

Now we implement the Right Solution, which is to check for loops directly 
when adding superclasses.  It's a bit like the occurs check in unification.

Note [Recursive instances and superclases]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this code, which arises in the context of "Scrap Your 
Boilerplate with Class".  

    class Sat a
    class Data ctx a
    instance  Sat (ctx Char)             => Data ctx Char
    instance (Sat (ctx [a]), Data ctx a) => Data ctx [a]

    class Data Maybe a => Foo a

    instance Foo t => Sat (Maybe t)

    instance Data Maybe a => Foo a
    instance Foo a        => Foo [a]
    instance                 Foo [Char]

In the instance for Foo [a], when generating evidence for the superclasses
(ie in tcSimplifySuperClasses) we need a superclass (Data Maybe [a]).
Using the instance for Data, we therefore need
        (Sat (Maybe [a], Data Maybe a)
But we are given (Foo a), and hence its superclass (Data Maybe a).
So that leaves (Sat (Maybe [a])).  Using the instance for Sat means
we need (Foo [a]).  And that is the very dictionary we are bulding
an instance for!  So we must put that in the "givens".  So in this
case we have
	Given:  Foo a, Foo [a]
	Wanted: Data Maybe [a]

BUT we must *not not not* put the *superclasses* of (Foo [a]) in
the givens, which is what 'addGiven' would normally do. Why? Because
(Data Maybe [a]) is the superclass, so we'd "satisfy" the wanted 
by selecting a superclass from Foo [a], which simply makes a loop.

On the other hand we *must* put the superclasses of (Foo a) in
the givens, as you can see from the derivation described above.

Conclusion: in the very special case of tcSimplifySuperClasses
we have one 'given' (namely the "this" dictionary) whose superclasses
must not be added to 'givens' by addGiven.  

There is a complication though.  Suppose there are equalities
      instance (Eq a, a~b) => Num (a,b)
Then we normalise the 'givens' wrt the equalities, so the original
given "this" dictionary is cast to one of a different type.  So it's a
bit trickier than before to identify the "special" dictionary whose
superclasses must not be added. See test
   indexed-types/should_run/EqInInstance

We need a persistent property of the dictionary to record this
special-ness.  Current I'm using the InstLocOrigin (a bit of a hack,
but cool), which is maintained by dictionary normalisation.
Specifically, the InstLocOrigin is
	     NoScOrigin
then the no-superclass thing kicks in.  WATCH OUT if you fiddle
with InstLocOrigin!

Note [MATCHING-SYNONYMS]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When trying to match a dictionary (D tau) to a top-level instance, or a 
type family equation (F taus_1 ~ tau_2) to a top-level family instance, 
we do *not* need to expand type synonyms because the matcher will do that for us.


Note [RHS-FAMILY-SYNONYMS] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The RHS of a family instance is represented as yet another constructor which is 
like a type synonym for the real RHS the programmer declared. Eg: 
    type instance F (a,a) = [a] 
Becomes: 
    :R32 a = [a]      -- internal type synonym introduced
    F (a,a) ~ :R32 a  -- instance 

When we react a family instance with a type family equation in the work list 
we keep the synonym-using RHS without expansion.

Note [Adding Derived Superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Generally speaking, we want to be able to add derived superclasses of
unsolved wanteds, and wanteds that have been partially being solved
via an instance. This is important to be able to simplify the inferred
constraints more (and to allow for recursive dictionaries, less
importantly). Example:

Inferred wanted constraint is (Eq a, Ord a), but we'd only like to
quantify over Ord a, hence we would like to be able to add the
superclass of Ord a as Derived and use it to solve the wanted Eq a.

Hence we will add Derived superclasses in the following two cases: 
    (1) When we meet an unsolved wanted in top-level reactions
    (2) When we partially solve a wanted in top-level reactions using an instance decl.

At that point, we have two options:
    (1) Add transitively add *ALL* of the superclasses of the Derived
    (2) Add only the immediate ones, but whenever we meet a Derived in
        the future, add its own superclasses as Derived.

Option (2) is terrible, because deriveds may be rewritten or kicked
out of the inert set, which will result in slightly rewritten
superclasses being reintroduced in the worklist and the inert set. Eg:

    class C a => B a 
    instance Foo a => B [a] 

Original constraints: 
[Wanted] d : B [a] 
[Given] co : a ~ Int 

We apply the instance to the wanted and put it and its superclasses as
as Deriveds in the inerts:

[Derived] d : B [a] 
[Derived] (sel d) : C [a]

The work is now: 
[Given] co  : a ~ Int 
[Wanted] d' : Foo a 

Now, suppose that we interact the Derived with the Given equality, and
kick him out of the inert, the next time around a superclass C [Int]
will be produced -- but we already *have* C [a] in the inerts which
will anyway get rewritten to C [Int].

So we choose (1), and *never* introduce any more superclass work from
Deriveds.  This enables yet another optimisation: If we ever meet an
equality that can rewrite a Derived, if that Derived is a superclass
derived (like C [a] above), i.e. not a partially solved one (like B
[a]) above, we may simply completely *discard* that Derived. The
reason is because somewhere in the inert lies the original wanted, or
partially solved constraint that gave rise to that superclass, and
that constraint *will* be kicked out, and *will* result in the
rewritten superclass to be added in the inerts later on, anyway.



Note [FunDep and implicit parameter reactions] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, our story of interacting two dictionaries (or a dictionary
and top-level instances) for functional dependencies, and implicit
paramters, is that we simply produce new wanted equalities.  So for example

        class D a b | a -> b where ... 
    Inert: 
        d1 :g D Int Bool
    WorkItem: 
        d2 :w D Int alpha

    We generate the extra work item
        cv :w alpha ~ Bool
    where 'cv' is currently unused.  However, this new item reacts with d2,
    discharging it in favour of a new constraint d2' thus:
        d2' :w D Int Bool
	d2 := d2' |> D Int cv
    Now d2' can be discharged from d1

We could be more aggressive and try to *immediately* solve the dictionary 
using those extra equalities. With the same inert set and work item we
might dischard d2 directly:

        cv :w alpha ~ Bool
        d2 := d1 |> D Int cv

But in general it's a bit painful to figure out the necessary coercion,
so we just take the first approach. Here is a better example. Consider:
    class C a b c | a -> b 
And: 
     [Given]  d1 : C T Int Char 
     [Wanted] d2 : C T beta Int 
In this case, it's *not even possible* to solve the wanted immediately. 
So we should simply output the functional dependency and add this guy
[but NOT its superclasses] back in the worklist. Even worse: 
     [Given] d1 : C T Int beta 
     [Wanted] d2: C T beta Int 
Then it is solvable, but its very hard to detect this on the spot. 

It's exactly the same with implicit parameters, except that the
"aggressive" approach would be much easier to implement.

Note [When improvement happens]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We fire an improvement rule when

  * Two constraints match (modulo the fundep)
      e.g. C t1 t2, C t1 t3    where C a b | a->b
    The two match because the first arg is identical

  * At least one is not Given.  If they are both given, we don't fire
    the reaction because we have no way of constructing evidence for a
    new equality nor does it seem right to create a new wanted goal
    (because the goal will most likely contain untouchables, which
    can't be solved anyway)!
   
Note that we *do* fire the improvement if one is Given and one is Derived.
The latter can be a superclass of a wanted goal. Example (tcfail138)
    class L a b | a -> b
    class (G a, L a b) => C a b

    instance C a b' => G (Maybe a)
    instance C a b  => C (Maybe a) a
    instance L (Maybe a) a

When solving the superclasses of the (C (Maybe a) a) instance, we get
  Given:  C a b  ... and hance by superclasses, (G a, L a b)
  Wanted: G (Maybe a)
Use the instance decl to get
  Wanted: C a b'
The (C a b') is inert, so we generate its Derived superclasses (L a b'),
and now we need improvement between that derived superclass an the Given (L a b)

Note [Overriding implicit parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   f :: (?x::a) -> Bool -> a
  
   g v = let ?x::Int = 3 
         in (f v, let ?x::Bool = True in f v)

This should probably be well typed, with
   g :: Bool -> (Int, Bool)

So the inner binding for ?x::Bool *overrides* the outer one.
Hence a work-item Given overrides an inert-item Given.

Note [Given constraint that matches an instance declaration]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What should we do when we discover that one (or more) top-level 
instances match a given (or solved) class constraint? We have 
two possibilities:

  1. Reject the program. The reason is that there may not be a unique
     best strategy for the solver. Example, from the OutsideIn(X) paper:
       instance P x => Q [x] 
       instance (x ~ y) => R [x] y 
     
       wob :: forall a b. (Q [b], R b a) => a -> Int 

       g :: forall a. Q [a] => [a] -> Int 
       g x = wob x 

       will generate the impliation constraint: 
            Q [a] => (Q [beta], R beta [a]) 
       If we react (Q [beta]) with its top-level axiom, we end up with a 
       (P beta), which we have no way of discharging. On the other hand, 
       if we react R beta [a] with the top-level we get  (beta ~ a), which 
       is solvable and can help us rewrite (Q [beta]) to (Q [a]) which is 
       now solvable by the given Q [a]. 
 
     However, this option is restrictive, for instance [Example 3] from 
     Note [Recursive dictionaries] will fail to work. 

  2. Ignore the problem, hoping that the situations where there exist indeed
     such multiple strategies are rare: Indeed the cause of the previous 
     problem is that (R [x] y) yields the new work (x ~ y) which can be 
     *spontaneously* solved, not using the givens. 

We are choosing option 2 below but we might consider having a flag as well.


Note [New Wanted Superclass Work] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Even in the case of wanted constraints, we add all of its superclasses as 
new given work. There are several reasons for this: 
     a) to minimise error messages; 
        eg suppose we have wanted (Eq a, Ord a)
	     then we report only (Ord a) unsoluble

     b) to make the smallest number of constraints when *inferring* a type
        (same Eq/Ord example)

     c) for recursive dictionaries we *must* add the superclasses
        so that we can use them when solving a sub-problem

     d) To allow FD-like improvement for type families. Assume that 
        we have a class 
             class C a b | a -> b 
        and we have to solve the implication constraint: 
             C a b => C a beta 
        Then, FD improvement can help us to produce a new wanted (beta ~ b) 

        We want to have the same effect with the type family encoding of 
        functional dependencies. Namely, consider: 
             class (F a ~ b) => C a b 
        Now suppose that we have: 
               given: C a b 
               wanted: C a beta 
        By interacting the given we will get given (F a ~ b) which is not 
        enough by itself to make us discharge (C a beta). However, we 
        may create a new derived equality from the super-class of the
        wanted constraint (C a beta), namely derived (F a ~ beta). 
        Now we may interact this with given (F a ~ b) to get: 
                  derived :  beta ~ b 
        But 'beta' is a touchable unification variable, and hence OK to 
        unify it with 'b', replacing the derived evidence with the identity. 

        This requires trySpontaneousSolve to solve *derived*
        equalities that have a touchable in their RHS, *in addition*
        to solving wanted equalities.

Here is another example where this is useful. 

Example 1:
----------
   class (F a ~ b) => C a b 
And we are given the wanteds:
      w1 : C a b 
      w2 : C a c 
      w3 : b ~ c 
We surely do *not* want to quantify over (b ~ c), since if someone provides
dictionaries for (C a b) and (C a c), these dictionaries can provide a proof 
of (b ~ c), hence no extra evidence is necessary. Here is what will happen: 

     Step 1: We will get new *given* superclass work, 
             provisionally to our solving of w1 and w2
             
               g1: F a ~ b, g2 : F a ~ c, 
               w1 : C a b, w2 : C a c, w3 : b ~ c

             The evidence for g1 and g2 is a superclass evidence term: 

               g1 := sc w1, g2 := sc w2

     Step 2: The givens will solve the wanted w3, so that 
               w3 := sym (sc w1) ; sc w2 
                  
     Step 3: Now, one may naively assume that then w2 can be solve from w1
             after rewriting with the (now solved equality) (b ~ c). 
             
             But this rewriting is ruled out by the isGoodRectDict! 

Conclusion, we will (correctly) end up with the unsolved goals 
    (C a b, C a c)   

NB: The desugarer needs be more clever to deal with equalities 
    that participate in recursive dictionary bindings.
