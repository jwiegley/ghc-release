This module implements two useful tools:

  1. An iterative solver for dataflow problems

  2. The combined dataflow-analysis-and-transformation framework
     described by Lerner, Grove, and Chambers in their excellent
     2002 POPL paper (http://tinyurl.com/3zycbr or 
     http://tinyurl.com/3pnscd).

Each tool comes in two flavors: one for forward dataflow problems
and one for backward dataflow problems.

We quote the paper above:

  Dataflow analyses can have mutually beneficial interactions.
  Previous efforts to exploit these interactions have either
  (1) iteratively performed each individual analysis until no
  further improvements are discovered or (2) developed "super-
  analyses" that manually combine conceptually separate anal-
  yses. We have devised a new approach that allows anal-
  yses to be defined independently while still enabling them
  to be combined automatically and profitably. Our approach
  avoids the loss of precision associated with iterating indi-
  vidual analyses and the implementation difficulties of man-
  ually writing a super-analysis.    

The key idea is to provide at each CFG node not only a dataflow
transfer function but also a rewriting function that has the option to
replace the node with a new (possibly empty) graph.  The rewriting
function takes a dataflow fact as input, and the fact is used to
justify any rewriting.  For example, in a backward problem, the fact
that variable x is dead can be used to justify rewriting node
  x := e
to the empty graph.  In a forward problem, the fact that x == 7 can
be used to justify rewriting node
  y := x + 1
to 
  y := 8
which in turn will be analyzed and produce a new fact:
x == 7 and y == 8.

In its most general form, this module takes as input graph, transfer
equations, rewrites, and an initial set of dataflow facts, and
iteratively computes a new graph and a new set of dataflow facts such
that
  * The set of facts is a fixed point of the transfer equations
  * The graph has been rewritten as much as is consistent with
    the given facts and requested rewriting depth (see below)
N.B. 'A set of facts' is shorthand for 'A finite map from CFG label to fact'.

The types of transfer equations, rewrites, and fixed points are
different for forward and backward problems.  To avoid cluttering the
name space with two versions of every name, other names such as
zdfSolveFrom are overloaded to work in both forward or backward
directions.  This design decision is based on experience with the
predecessor module, which has been mercifully deleted.


This module is deliberately very abstract.  It is a completely general
framework and well-nigh impossible to understand in isolation.  The
cautious reader will begin with some concrete examples in the form of
clients.  NR recommends

  CmmLiveZ             A simple liveness analysis

  CmmSpillReload.removeDeadAssignmentsAndReloads
                       A piece of spaghetti to pull on, which leads to
                         - a two-part liveness analysis that tracks
                           variables live in registers and live on the stack
                         - elimination of assignments to dead variables
                         - elimination of redundant reloads

Even hearty souls should avoid the CmmProcPointZ client, at least for
the time being.

{- ============ TRANSFER FUNCTIONS AND REWRITES =========== -}

-- | For a backward transfer, you're given the fact on a node's 
-- outedge and you compute the fact on the inedge.  Facts have type 'a'.
-- A last node may have multiple outedges, each pointing to a labelled
-- block, so instead of a fact it is given a mapping from BlockId to fact.

data BackwardTransfers middle last a = BackwardTransfers
    { bt_first_in  :: BlockId -> a              -> a
    , bt_middle_in :: middle  -> a              -> a
    , bt_last_in   :: last    -> (BlockId -> a) -> a
    } 

-- | For a forward transfer, you're given the fact on a node's 
-- inedge and you compute the fact on the outedge. Because a last node
-- may have multiple outedges, each pointing to a labelled
-- block, so instead of a fact it produces a list of (BlockId, fact) pairs.

data ForwardTransfers middle last a = ForwardTransfers
    { ft_first_out  :: BlockId -> a -> a
    , ft_middle_out :: middle  -> a -> a
    , ft_last_outs  :: last    -> a -> LastOutFacts a
    , ft_exit_out   ::            a -> a
    } 

newtype LastOutFacts a = LastOutFacts [(BlockId, a)] 
  -- ^ These are facts flowing out of a last node to the node's successors.
  -- They are either to be set (if they pertain to the graph currently
  -- under analysis) or propagated out of a sub-analysis


-- | A backward rewrite takes the same inputs as a backward transfer,
-- but instead of producing a fact, it produces a replacement graph or Nothing.

data BackwardRewrites middle last a = BackwardRewrites
    { br_first  :: BlockId -> a              -> Maybe (AGraph middle last)
    , br_middle :: middle  -> a              -> Maybe (AGraph middle last)
    , br_last   :: last    -> (BlockId -> a) -> Maybe (AGraph middle last)
    , br_exit   ::                              Maybe (AGraph middle last)
    } 

-- | A forward rewrite takes the same inputs as a forward transfer,
-- but instead of producing a fact, it produces a replacement graph or Nothing.

data ForwardRewrites middle last a = ForwardRewrites
    { fr_first  :: BlockId -> a -> Maybe (AGraph middle last)
    , fr_middle :: middle  -> a -> Maybe (AGraph middle last)

    } 

{- ===================== FIXED POINTS =================== -}

-- | The result of combined analysis and transformation is a 
-- solution to the set of dataflow equations together with a 'contained value'.
-- This solution is a member of type class 'FixedPoint', which is parameterized by
--   * middle and last nodes 'm' and 'l'
--   * data flow fact 'fact'
--   * the type 'a' of the contained value
--
-- In practice, the contained value 'zdfFpContents' is either a
-- rewritten graph, when rewriting, or (), when solving without
-- rewriting.  A function 'zdfFpMap' allows a client to change 
-- the contents without changing other values.
--
-- To save space, we provide the solution 'zdfFpFacts' as a mapping
-- from BlockId to fact; if necessary, facts on edges can be
-- reconstructed using the transfer functions; this functionality is
-- intended to be included as the 'zdfDecoratedGraph', but the code
-- has not yet been implemented.
--
-- The solution may also includes a fact 'zdfFpOuputFact', which is
-- not associated with any label:
--   * for a backward problem, this is the fact at entry
--   * for a forward problem, this is the fact at the distinguished exit node,
--     if such a node is present
--
-- For a forward problem only, the solution includes 'zdfFpLastOuts',
-- which is the set of facts on edges leaving the graph.
--
-- The flag 'zdfGraphChanged' tells whether the engine did any rewriting.

    zdfGraphChanged   :: fp m l fact a -> ChangeFlag

-- | The class 'FixedPoint' has two instances: one for forward problems and
-- one for backward problems.  The 'CommonFixedPoint' defines all fields 
-- common to both.  (The instance declarations are uninteresting and appear below.)

data CommonFixedPoint m l fact a = FP

-- | 'zdfSolveFrom' is an overloaded name that resolves to a pure
-- analysis with no rewriting.  It has only two instances: forward and
-- backward.  Since it needs no rewrites, the type parameters of the

--
-- An iterative solver normally starts with the bottom fact at every
-- node, but it can be useful in other contexts as well.  For this
-- reason the initial set of facts (at labelled blocks only) is a
-- parameter to the solver.  
--
-- The constraints on the type signature exist purely for debugging;
-- they make it possible to prettyprint nodes and facts.  The parameter of
-- type 'PassName' is also used just for debugging.
--
-- Note that the result is a fixed point with no contents, that is,
-- the contents have type ().
-- 
-- The intent of the rest of the type signature should be obvious.
-- If not, place a skype call to norman-ramsey or complain bitterly
-- to <norman-ramsey@acm.org>.
