Bindings

\begin{code}

	    -> OccEnv		-- Same, but trimmed by (binderOf bind)
            -> CoreBind
            -> UsageDetails             -- Usage details of scope
            -> (UsageDetails,           -- Of the whole let(rec)
                [CoreBind])

occAnalBind env _ (NonRec binder rhs) body_usage
  | isTyCoVar binder			-- A type let; we don't gather usage info
  = (body_usage, [NonRec binder rhs])

  | not (binder `usedIn` body_usage)    -- It's not mentioned
  = (body_usage, [])

  | otherwise                   -- It's mentioned in the body
  = (body_usage' +++ addRuleUsage rhs_usage binder,     -- Note [Rules are extra RHSs]
     [NonRec tagged_binder rhs'])
  where
    (body_usage', tagged_binder) = tagBinder body_usage binder
    (rhs_usage, rhs')            = occAnalRhs env tagged_binder rhs
\end{code}

Note [Dead code]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dropping dead code for recursive bindings is done in a very simple way:

        the entire set of bindings is dropped if none of its binders are
        mentioned in its body; otherwise none are.

This seems to miss an obvious improvement.

        letrec  f = ...g...
                g = ...f...
        in
        ...g...
===>
        letrec f = ...g...
               g = ...(...g...)...
        in
        ...g...

Now 'f' is unused! But it's OK!  Dependency analysis will sort this
out into a letrec for 'g' and a 'let' for 'f', and then 'f' will get
dropped.  It isn't easy to do a perfect job in one blow.  Consider

        letrec f = ...g...
               g = ...h...
               h = ...k...
               k = ...m...
               m = ...m...
        in
        ...m...


Note [Loop breaking and RULES]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Loop breaking is surprisingly subtle.  First read the section 4 of
"Secrets of the GHC inliner".  This describes our basic plan.

However things are made quite a bit more complicated by RULES.  Remember

  * Note [Rules are extra RHSs]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A RULE for 'f' is like an extra RHS for 'f'. That way the "parent"
    keeps the specialised "children" alive.  If the parent dies
    (because it isn't referenced any more), then the children will die
    too (unless they are already referenced directly).

    To that end, we build a Rec group for each cyclic strongly
    connected component,
        *treating f's rules as extra RHSs for 'f'*.
    More concretely, the SCC analysis runs on a graph with an edge
    from f -> g iff g is mentioned in
        (a) f's rhs
        (b) f's RULES
    These are rec_edges.

    Under (b) we include variables free in *either* LHS *or* RHS of
    the rule.  The former might seems silly, but see Note [Rule
    dependency info].  So in Example [eftInt], eftInt and eftIntFB
    will be put in the same Rec, even though their 'main' RHSs are
    both non-recursive.

  * Note [Rules are visible in their own rec group]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    We want the rules for 'f' to be visible in f's right-hand side.
    And we'd like them to be visible in other functions in f's Rec
    group.  E.g. in Example [Specialisation rules] we want f' rule
    to be visible in both f's RHS, and fs's RHS.

    This means that we must simplify the RULEs first, before looking
    at any of the definitions.  This is done by Simplify.simplRecBind,
    when it calls addLetIdInfo.

  * Note [Choosing loop breakers]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    We avoid infinite inlinings by choosing loop breakers, and
    ensuring that a loop breaker cuts each loop.  But what is a
    "loop"?  In particular, a RULE is like an equation for 'f' that
    is *always* inlined if it is applicable.  We do *not* disable
    rules for loop-breakers.  It's up to whoever makes the rules to
    make sure that the rules themselves always terminate.  See Note
    [Rules for recursive functions] in Simplify.lhs

    Hence, if
        f's RHS mentions g, and
        g has a RULE that mentions h, and
        h has a RULE that mentions f

    then we *must* choose f to be a loop breaker.  In general, take the
    free variables of f's RHS, and augment it with all the variables
    reachable by RULES from those starting points.  That is the whole
    reason for computing rule_fv_env in occAnalBind.  (Of course we
    only consider free vars that are also binders in this Rec group.)

    Note that when we compute this rule_fv_env, we only consider variables
    free in the *RHS* of the rule, in contrast to the way we build the
    Rec group in the first place (Note [Rule dependency info])

    Note that if 'g' has RHS that mentions 'w', we should add w to
    g's loop-breaker edges.  More concretely there is an edge from f -> g 
    iff
    	(a) g is mentioned in f's RHS
	(b) h is mentioned in f's RHS, and 
            g appears in the RHS of a RULE of h
            or a transitive sequence of rules starting with h

    Note that in Example [eftInt], *neither* eftInt *nor* eftIntFB is
    chosen as a loop breaker, because their RHSs don't mention each other.
    And indeed both can be inlined safely.

    Note that the edges of the graph we use for computing loop breakers
    are not the same as the edges we use for computing the Rec blocks.
    That's why we compute
        rec_edges          for the Rec block analysis
        loop_breaker_edges for the loop breaker analysis


  * Note [Weak loop breakers]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    There is a last nasty wrinkle.  Suppose we have

        Rec { f = f_rhs
              RULE f [] = g

              h = h_rhs
              g = h
              ...more...
        }

    Remmber that we simplify the RULES before any RHS (see Note
    [Rules are visible in their own rec group] above).

    So we must *not* postInlineUnconditionally 'g', even though
    its RHS turns out to be trivial.  (I'm assuming that 'g' is
    not choosen as a loop breaker.)  Why not?  Because then we
    drop the binding for 'g', which leaves it out of scope in the
    RULE!

    We "solve" this by making g a "weak" or "rules-only" loop breaker,
    with OccInfo = IAmLoopBreaker True.  A normal "strong" loop breaker
    has IAmLoopBreaker False.  So

                                Inline  postInlineUnconditionally
        IAmLoopBreaker False    no      no
        IAmLoopBreaker True     yes     no
        other                   yes     yes

    The **sole** reason for this kind of loop breaker is so that
    postInlineUnconditionally does not fire.  Ugh.

  * Note [Rule dependency info]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The VarSet in a SpecInfo is used for dependency analysis in the
    occurrence analyser.  We must track free vars in *both* lhs and rhs.  
    Hence use of idRuleVars, rather than idRuleRhsVars in addRuleUsage.  
    Why both? Consider
        x = y
        RULE f x = 4
    Then if we substitute y for x, we'd better do so in the
    rule's LHS too, so we'd better ensure the dependency is respected


  * Note [Inline rules]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    None of the above stuff about RULES applies to Inline Rules,
    stored in a CoreUnfolding.  The unfolding, if any, is simplified
    at the same time as the regular RHS of the function, so it should
    be treated *exactly* like an extra RHS.


Example [eftInt]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example (from GHC.Enum):

  eftInt :: Int# -> Int# -> [Int]
  eftInt x y = ...(non-recursive)...

  {-# INLINE [0] eftIntFB #-}
  eftIntFB :: (Int -> r -> r) -> r -> Int# -> Int# -> r
  eftIntFB c n x y = ...(non-recursive)...

  {-# RULES
  "eftInt"  [~1] forall x y. eftInt x y = build (\ c n -> eftIntFB c n x y)
  "eftIntList"  [1] eftIntFB  (:) [] = eftInt
   #-}

Example [Specialisation rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this group, which is typical of what SpecConstr builds:

   fs a = ....f (C a)....
   f  x = ....f (C a)....
   {-# RULE f (C a) = fs a #-}

So 'f' and 'fs' are in the same Rec group (since f refers to fs via its RULE).

But watch out!  If 'fs' is not chosen as a loop breaker, we may get an infinite loop:
        - the RULE is applied in f's RHS (see Note [Self-recursive rules] in Simplify
        - fs is inlined (say it's small)
        - now there's another opportunity to apply the RULE

This showed up when compiling Control.Concurrent.Chan.getChanContents.

@reOrderRec@ is applied to the list of (binder,rhs) pairs for a cyclic
strongly connected component (there's guaranteed to be a cycle).  It returns the
same pairs, but
        a) in a better order,
        b) with some of the Ids having a IAmALoopBreaker pragma

The "loop-breaker" Ids are sufficient to break all cycles in the SCC.  This means
that the simplifier can guarantee not to loop provided it never records an inlining
for these no-inline guys.

Furthermore, the order of the binds is such that if we neglect dependencies
on the no-inline Ids then the binds are topologically sorted.  This means
that the simplifier will generally do a good job if it works from top bottom,
recording inlinings for any Ids which aren't marked as "no-inline" as it goes.

==============
[June 98: I don't understand the following paragraphs, and I've
          changed the a=b case again so that it isn't a special case any more.]

Here's a case that bit me:

        letrec
                a = b
                b = \x. BIG
        in
        ...a...a...a....

Re-ordering doesn't change the order of bindings, but there was no loop-breaker.

My solution was to make a=b bindings record b as Many, rather like INLINE bindings.
Perhaps something cleverer would suffice.

Note [Complexity of loop breaking]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The loop-breaking algorithm knocks out one binder at a time, and 
performs a new SCC analysis on the remaining binders.  That can
behave very badly in tightly-coupled groups of bindings; in the
worst case it can be (N**2)*log N, because it does a full SCC
on N, then N-1, then N-2 and so on.

To avoid this, we switch plans after 2 (or whatever) attempts:
  Plan A: pick one binder with the lowest score, make it
	  a loop breaker, and try again
  Plan B: pick *all* binders with the lowest score, make them
	  all loop breakers, and try again 
Since there are only a small finite number of scores, this will
terminate in a constant number of iterations, rather than O(N)
iterations.

You might thing that it's very unlikely, but RULES make it much
more likely.  Here's a real example from Trac #1969:
  Rec { $dm = \d.\x. op d
	{-# RULES forall d. $dm Int d  = $s$dm1
		  forall d. $dm Bool d = $s$dm2 #-}
	
	dInt = MkD .... opInt ...
	dInt = MkD .... opBool ...
	opInt  = $dm dInt
	opBool = $dm dBool

	$s$dm1 = \x. op dInt
	$s$dm2 = \x. op dBool }
The RULES stuff means that we can't choose $dm as a loop breaker
(Note [Choosing loop breakers]), so we must choose at least (say)
opInt *and* opBool, and so on.  The number of loop breakders is
linear in the number of instance declarations.

Note [INLINE pragmas]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Avoid choosing a function with an INLINE pramga as the loop breaker!  
If such a function is mutually-recursive with a non-INLINE thing,
then the latter should be the loop-breaker.

Usually this is just a question of optimisation. But a particularly
bad case is wrappers generated by the demand analyser: if you make
then into a loop breaker you may get an infinite inlining loop.  For
example:
  rec {
        $wfoo x = ....foo x....

        {-loop brk-} foo x = ...$wfoo x...
  }
The interface file sees the unfolding for $wfoo, and sees that foo is
strict (and hence it gets an auto-generated wrapper).  Result: an
infinite inlining in the importing scope.  So be a bit careful if you
change this.  A good example is Tree.repTree in
nofib/spectral/minimax. If the repTree wrapper is chosen as the loop
breaker then compiling Game.hs goes into an infinite loop.  This
happened when we gave is_con_app a lower score than inline candidates:

  Tree.repTree
    = __inline_me (/\a. \w w1 w2 -> 
                   case Tree.$wrepTree @ a w w1 w2 of
                    { (# ww1, ww2 #) -> Branch @ a ww1 ww2 })
  Tree.$wrepTree
    = /\a w w1 w2 -> 
      (# w2_smP, map a (Tree a) (Tree.repTree a w1 w) (w w2) #)

Here we do *not* want to choose 'repTree' as the loop breaker.

Note [DFuns should not be loop breakers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's particularly bad to make a DFun into a loop breaker.  See
Note [How instance declarations are translated] in TcInstDcls

We give DFuns a higher score than ordinary CONLIKE things because 
if there's a choice we want the DFun to be the non-looop breker. Eg
 
rec { sc = /\ a \$dC. $fBWrap (T a) ($fCT @ a $dC)

      $fCT :: forall a_afE. (Roman.C a_afE) => Roman.C (Roman.T a_afE)
      {-# DFUN #-}
      $fCT = /\a \$dC. MkD (T a) ((sc @ a $dC) |> blah) ($ctoF @ a $dC)
    }

Here 'sc' (the superclass) looks CONLIKE, but we'll never get to it
if we can't unravel the DFun first.

Note [Constructor applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's really really important to inline dictionaries.  Real
example (the Enum Ordering instance from GHC.Base):

     rec     f = \ x -> case d of (p,q,r) -> p x
             g = \ x -> case d of (p,q,r) -> q x
             d = (v, f, g)

Here, f and g occur just once; but we can't inline them into d.
On the other hand we *could* simplify those case expressions if
we didn't stupidly choose d as the loop breaker.
But we won't because constructor args are marked "Many".
Inlining dictionaries is really essential to unravelling
the loops in static numeric dictionaries, see GHC.Float.

Note [Closure conversion]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We treat (\x. C p q) as a high-score candidate in the letrec scoring algorithm.
The immediate motivation came from the result of a closure-conversion transformation
which generated code like this:

    data Clo a b = forall c. Clo (c -> a -> b) c

    ($:) :: Clo a b -> a -> b
    Clo f env $: x = f env x

    rec { plus = Clo plus1 ()

        ; plus1 _ n = Clo plus2 n

        ; plus2 Zero     n = n
        ; plus2 (Succ m) n = Succ (plus $: m $: n) }

If we inline 'plus' and 'plus1', everything unravels nicely.  But if
we choose 'plus1' as the loop breaker (which is entirely possible
otherwise), the loop does not unravel nicely.


@occAnalRhs@ deals with the question of bindings where the Id is marked
by an INLINE pragma.  For these we record that anything which occurs
in its RHS occurs many times.  This pessimistically assumes that ths
inlined binder also occurs many times in its scope, but if it doesn't
we'll catch it next time round.  At worst this costs an extra simplifier pass.
ToDo: try using the occurrence info for the inline'd binder.

[March 97] We do the same for atomic RHSs.  Reason: see notes with reOrderRec.
[June 98, SLPJ]  I've undone this change; I don't understand it.  See notes with reOrderRec.

        -> CoreExpr
        -> (UsageDetails,       -- Gives info only about the "interesting" Ids
            CoreExpr)

occAnal _   (Type t)  = (emptyDetails, Type t)
occAnal env (Var v)   = (mkOneOcc env v False, Var v)
    -- At one stage, I gathered the idRuleVars for v here too,
    -- which in a way is the right thing to do.
    -- But that went wrong right after specialisation, when
    -- the *occurrences* of the overloaded function didn't have any
    -- rules in them, so the *specialised* versions looked as if they
    -- weren't used at all.
\end{code}

We regard variables that occur as constructor arguments as "dangerousToDup":

\begin{verbatim}
module A where
f x = let y = expensive x in
      let z = (True,y) in
      (case z of {(p,q)->q}, case z of {(p,q)->q})
\end{verbatim}

We feel free to duplicate the WHNF (True,y), but that means
that y may be duplicated thereby.

If we aren't careful we duplicate the (expensive x) call!
Constructors are rather like lambdas in this way.

\begin{code}
occAnal _   expr@(Lit _) = (emptyDetails, expr)
\end{code}

\begin{code}

  = case occAnal env expr of { (usage, expr') ->
      (markManyIf (isRhsEnv env) usage, Cast expr' co)
        -- If we see let x = y `cast` co
        -- then mark y as 'Many' so that we don't
        -- immediately inline y again.

    }

-- For value lambdas we do a special hack.  Consider
--      (\x. \y. ...x...)
-- If we did nothing, x is used inside the \y, so would be marked
-- as dangerous to dup.  But in the common case where the abstraction
-- is applied to two arguments this is over-pessimistic.
-- So instead, we just mark each binder with its occurrence
-- info in the *body* of the multiple lambda.
-- Then, the simplifier is careful when partially applying lambdas.

Note [Binders in case alternatives]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
    case x of y { (a,b) -> f y }
We treat 'a', 'b' as dead, because they don't physically occur in the
case alternative.  (Indeed, a variable is dead iff it doesn't occur in
its scope in the output of OccAnal.)  It really helps to know when
binders are unused.  See esp the call to isDeadBinder in
Simplify.mkDupableAlt

In this example, though, the Simplifier will bring 'a' and 'b' back to
life, beause it binds 'y' to (a,b) (imagine got inlined and
scrutinised y).

Note [ImpRuleUsage]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this, where A.g is an imported Id
 
   f x = A.g x
   {-# RULE "foo" forall x. A.g x = f x #-}

Obviously there's a loop, but the danger is that the occurrence analyser
will say that 'f' is not a loop breaker.  Then the simplifier will 
optimise 'f' to
   f x = f x
and then gaily inline 'f'.  Result infinite loop.  More realistically, 
these kind of rules are generated when specialising imported INLINABLE Ids.

Solution: treat an occurrence of A.g as an occurrence of all the local Ids
that occur on the RULE's RHS.  This mapping from imported Id to local Ids
is held in occ_rule_fvs.

\end{code}

Note [ProxyEnv]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ProxyEnv keeps track of the connection between case binders and
scrutinee.  Specifically, if
     sc |-> (sc, [...(cb, co)...])
is a binding in the ProxyEnv, then
     cb = sc |> coi
Typically we add such a binding when encountering the case expression
     case (sc |> coi) of cb { ... }

Things to note:
  * The domain of the ProxyEnv is the variable (or casted variable) 
    scrutinees of enclosing cases.  This is additionally used
    to ensure we gather occurrence info even for GlobalId scrutinees;
    see Note [Binder swap for GlobalId scrutinee]

  * The ProxyEnv is just an optimisation; you can throw away any 
    element without losing correctness.  And we do so when pushing
    it inside a binding (see trimProxyEnv).

  * One scrutinee might map to many case binders:  Eg
      case sc of cb1 { DEFAULT -> ....case sc of cb2 { ... } .. }

INVARIANTS
 * If sc1 |-> (sc2, [...(cb, co)...]), then sc1==sc2
   It's a UniqFM and we sometimes need the domain Id

 * Any particular case binder 'cb' occurs only once in entire range

 * No loops

The Main Reason for having a ProxyEnv is so that when we encounter
    case e of cb { pi -> ri }
we can find all the in-scope variables derivable from 'cb', 
and effectively add let-bindings for them (or at least for the
ones *mentioned* in ri) thus:
    case e of cb { pi -> let { x = ..cb..; y = ...cb.. }
                         in ri }
In this way we'll replace occurrences of 'x', 'y' with 'cb',
which implements the Binder-swap idea (see Note [Binder swap])

The function getProxies finds these bindings; then we 
add just the necessary ones, using wrapProxy. 

Note [Binder swap]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We do these two transformations right here:

 (1)   case x of b { pi -> ri }
    ==>
      case x of b { pi -> let x=b in ri }

 (2)  case (x |> co) of b { pi -> ri }
    ==>
      case (x |> co) of b { pi -> let x = b |> sym co in ri }

    Why (2)?  See Note [Case of cast]

In both cases, in a particular alternative (pi -> ri), we only 
add the binding if
  (a) x occurs free in (pi -> ri)
	(ie it occurs in ri, but is not bound in pi)
  (b) the pi does not bind b (or the free vars of co)
We need (a) and (b) for the inserted binding to be correct.

For the alternatives where we inject the binding, we can transfer
all x's OccInfo to b.  And that is the point.

Notice that 
  * The deliberate shadowing of 'x'. 
  * That (a) rapidly becomes false, so no bindings are injected.

The reason for doing these transformations here is because it allows
us to adjust the OccInfo for 'x' and 'b' as we go.

  * Suppose the only occurrences of 'x' are the scrutinee and in the
    ri; then this transformation makes it occur just once, and hence
    get inlined right away.

  * If we do this in the Simplifier, we don't know whether 'x' is used
    in ri, so we are forced to pessimistically zap b's OccInfo even
    though it is typically dead (ie neither it nor x appear in the
    ri).  There's nothing actually wrong with zapping it, except that
    it's kind of nice to know which variables are dead.  My nose
    tells me to keep this information as robustly as possible.

The Maybe (Id,CoreExpr) passed to occAnalAlt is the extra let-binding
{x=b}; it's Nothing if the binder-swap doesn't happen.

There is a danger though.  Consider
      let v = x +# y
      in case (f v) of w -> ...v...v...
And suppose that (f v) expands to just v.  Then we'd like to
use 'w' instead of 'v' in the alternative.  But it may be too
late; we may have substituted the (cheap) x+#y for v in the 
same simplifier pass that reduced (f v) to v.

I think this is just too bad.  CSE will recover some of it.

Note [Case of cast]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider        case (x `cast` co) of b { I# ->
                ... (case (x `cast` co) of {...}) ...
We'd like to eliminate the inner case.  That is the motivation for
equation (2) in Note [Binder swap].  When we get to the inner case, we
inline x, cancel the casts, and away we go.

Note [Binder swap on GlobalId scrutinees]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the scrutinee is a GlobalId we must take care in two ways

 i) In order to *know* whether 'x' occurs free in the RHS, we need its
    occurrence info. BUT, we don't gather occurrence info for
    GlobalIds.  That's one use for the (small) occ_proxy env in OccEnv is
    for: it says "gather occurrence info for these.

 ii) We must call localiseId on 'x' first, in case it's a GlobalId, or
     has an External Name. See, for example, SimplEnv Note [Global Ids in
     the substitution].

Note [getProxies is subtle]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The code for getProxies isn't all that obvious. Consider

  case v |> cov  of x { DEFAULT ->
  case x |> cox1 of y { DEFAULT ->
  case x |> cox2 of z { DEFAULT -> r

These will give us a ProxyEnv looking like:
  x |-> (x, [(y, cox1), (z, cox2)])
  v |-> (v, [(x, cov)])

From this we want to extract the bindings
    x = z |> sym cox2
    v = x |> sym cov
    y = x |> cox1

Notice that later bindings may mention earlier ones, and that
we need to go "both ways".

Historical note [no-case-of-case]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We *used* to suppress the binder-swap in case expressions when 
-fno-case-of-case is on.  Old remarks:
    "This happens in the first simplifier pass,
    and enhances full laziness.  Here's the bad case:
            f = \ y -> ...(case x of I# v -> ...(case x of ...) ... )
    If we eliminate the inner case, we trap it inside the I# v -> arm,
    which might prevent some full laziness happening.  I've seen this
    in action in spectral/cichelli/Prog.hs:
             [(m,n) | m <- [1..max], n <- [1..max]]
    Hence the check for NoCaseOfCase."
However, now the full-laziness pass itself reverses the binder-swap, so this
check is no longer necessary.

Historical note [Suppressing the case binder-swap]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This old note describes a problem that is also fixed by doing the
binder-swap in OccAnal:

    There is another situation when it might make sense to suppress the
    case-expression binde-swap. If we have

        case x of w1 { DEFAULT -> case x of w2 { A -> e1; B -> e2 }
                       ...other cases .... }

    We'll perform the binder-swap for the outer case, giving

        case x of w1 { DEFAULT -> case w1 of w2 { A -> e1; B -> e2 }
                       ...other cases .... }

    But there is no point in doing it for the inner case, because w1 can't
    be inlined anyway.  Furthermore, doing the case-swapping involves
    zapping w2's occurrence info (see paragraphs that follow), and that
    forces us to bind w2 when doing case merging.  So we get

        case x of w1 { A -> let w2 = w1 in e1
                       B -> let w2 = w1 in e2
                       ...other cases .... }

    This is plain silly in the common case where w2 is dead.

    Even so, I can't see a good way to implement this idea.  I tried
    not doing the binder-swap if the scrutinee was already evaluated
    but that failed big-time:

            data T = MkT !Int

            case v of w  { MkT x ->
            case x of x1 { I# y1 ->
            case x of x2 { I# y2 -> ...

    Notice that because MkT is strict, x is marked "evaluated".  But to
    eliminate the last case, we must either make sure that x (as well as
    x1) has unfolding MkT y1.  THe straightforward thing to do is to do
    the binder-swap.  So this whole note is a no-op.

It's fixed by doing the binder-swap in OccAnal because we can do the
binder-swap unconditionally and still get occurrence analysis
information right.
