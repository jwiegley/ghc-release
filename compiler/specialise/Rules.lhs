Note [Overall plumbing for rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* After the desugarer:
   - The ModGuts initially contains mg_rules :: [CoreRule] of
     locally-declared rules for imported Ids.  
   - Locally-declared rules for locally-declared Ids are attached to
     the IdInfo for that Id.  See Note [Attach rules to local ids] in
     DsBinds
 
* TidyPgm strips off all the rules from local Ids and adds them to
  mg_rules, so that the ModGuts has *all* the locally-declared rules.

* The HomePackageTable contains a ModDetails for each home package
  module.  Each contains md_rules :: [CoreRule] of rules declared in
  that module.  The HomePackageTable grows as ghc --make does its
  up-sweep.  In batch mode (ghc -c), the HPT is empty; all imported modules
  are treated by the "external" route, discussed next, regardless of
  which package they come from.

* The ExternalPackageState has a single eps_rule_base :: RuleBase for
  Ids in other packages.  This RuleBase simply grow monotonically, as
  ghc --make compiles one module after another.

  During simplification, interface files may get demand-loaded,
  as the simplifier explores the unfoldings for Ids it has in 
  its hand.  (Via an unsafePerformIO; the EPS is really a cache.)
  That in turn may make the EPS rule-base grow.  In contrast, the
  HPT never grows in this way.

* The result of all this is that during Core-to-Core optimisation
  there are four sources of rules:

    (a) Rules in the IdInfo of the Id they are a rule for.  These are
        easy: fast to look up, and if you apply a substitution then
        it'll be applied to the IdInfo as a matter of course.

    (b) Rules declared in this module for imported Ids, kept in the
        ModGuts. If you do a substitution, you'd better apply the
        substitution to these.  There are seldom many of these.

    (c) Rules declared in the HomePackageTable.  These never change.

    (d) Rules in the ExternalPackageTable. These can grow in response
        to lazy demand-loading of interfaces.

* At the moment (c) is carried in a reader-monad way by the CoreMonad.
  The HomePackageTable doesn't have a single RuleBase because technically
  we should only be able to "see" rules "below" this module; so we
  generate a RuleBase for (c) by combing rules from all the modules
  "below" us.  That's why we can't just select the home-package RuleBase
  from HscEnv.

  [NB: we are inconsistent here.  We should do the same for external
  pacakges, but we don't.  Same for type-class instances.]

* So in the outer simplifier loop, we combine (b-d) into a single
  RuleBase, reading 
     (b) from the ModGuts, 
     (c) from the CoreMonad, and
     (d) from its mutable variable
  [Of coures this means that we won't see new EPS rules that come in
  during a single simplifier iteration, but that probably does not
  matter.]

\subsection[specialisation-IdInfo]{Specialisation info about an @Id@}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

A @CoreRule@ holds details of one rule for an @Id@, which
includes its specialisations.

For example, if a rule for @f@ contains the mapping:
\begin{verbatim}
	forall a b d. [Type (List a), Type b, Var d]  ===>  f' a b
\end{verbatim}
then when we find an application of f to matching types, we simply replace
it by the matching RHS:
\begin{verbatim}
	f (List Int) Bool dict ===>  f' Int Bool
\end{verbatim}
All the stuff about how many dictionaries to discard, and what types
to apply the specialised function to, are handled by the fact that the
Rule contains a template for the result of the specialisation.

There is one more exciting case, which is dealt with in exactly the same
way.  If the specialised value is unboxed then it is lifted at its
definition site and unlifted at its uses.  For example:

	pi :: forall a. Num a => a

might have a specialisation

	[Int#] ===>  (case pi' of Lift pi# -> pi#)

where pi' :: Lift Int# is the specialised version of pi.

Note [Where rules are found]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rules for an Id come from two places:
  (a) the ones it is born with, stored inside the Id iself (idCoreRules fn),
  (b) rules added in other modules, stored in the global RuleBase (imp_rules)

It's tempting to think that 
     - LocalIds have only (a)
     - non-LocalIds have only (b)

but that isn't quite right:

     - PrimOps and ClassOps are born with a bunch of rules inside the Id,
       even when they are imported

     - The rules in PrelRules.builtinRules should be active even
       in the module defining the Id (when it's a LocalId), but 
       the rules are kept in the global RuleBase

Note [Extra args in rule matching]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we find a matching rule, we return (Just (rule, rhs)), 
but the rule firing has only consumed as many of the input args
as the ruleArity says.  It's up to the caller to keep track
of any left-over args.  E.g. if you call
	lookupRule ... f [e1, e2, e3]
and it returns Just (r, rhs), where r has ruleArity 2
then the real rewrite is
	f e1 e2 e3 ==> rhs e3

You might think it'd be cleaner for lookupRule to deal with the
leftover arguments, by applying 'rhs' to them, but the main call
in the Simplifier works better as it is.  Reason: the 'args' passed
to lookupRule are the result of a lazy substitution

\begin{code}
------------------------------------
matchRule :: (Activation -> Bool) -> IdUnfoldingFun
          -> InScopeSet
	  -> [CoreExpr] -> [Maybe Name]
	  -> CoreRule -> Maybe CoreExpr

-- If (matchRule rule args) returns Just (name,rhs)
-- then (f args) matches the rule, and the corresponding
-- rewritten RHS is rhs
--
-- The bndrs and rhs is occurrence-analysed
--
-- 	Example
--
-- The rule
--	forall f g x. map f (map g x) ==> map (f . g) x
-- is stored
--	CoreRule "map/map" 
--		 [f,g,x]		-- tpl_vars
--		 [f,map g x]		-- tpl_args
--		 map (f.g) x)		-- rhs
--	  
-- Then the call: matchRule the_rule [e1,map e2 e3]
--	  = Just ("map/map", (\f,g,x -> rhs) e1 e2 e3)
--
-- Any 'surplus' arguments in the input are simply put on the end
-- of the output.

Note [Template binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the following match:
	Template:  forall x.  f x 
	Target:     f (x+1)
This should succeed, because the template variable 'x' has 
nothing to do with the 'x' in the target. 

On reflection, this case probably does just work, but this might not
	Template:  forall x. f (\x.x) 
	Target:    f (\y.y)
Here we want to clone when we find the \x, but to know that x must be in scope

To achive this, we use rnBndrL to rename the template variables if
necessary; the renamed ones are the tmpl_vars'

Note [Expanding variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is another Very Important rule: if the term being matched is a
variable, we expand it so long as its unfolding is "expandable". (Its
occurrence information is not necessarily up to date, so we don't use
it.)  By "expandable" we mean a WHNF or a "constructor-like" application.
This is the key reason for "constructor-like" Ids.  If we have
     {-# NOINLINE [1] CONLIKE g #-}
     {-# RULE f (g x) = h x #-}
then in the term
   let v = g 3 in ....(f v)....
we want to make the rule fire, to replace (f v) with (h 3). 

Note [Do not expand locally-bound variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do *not* expand locally-bound variables, else there's a worry that the
unfolding might mention variables that are themselves renamed.
Example
	  case x of y { (p,q) -> ...y... }
Don't expand 'y' to (p,q) because p,q might themselves have been 
renamed.  Essentially we only expand unfoldings that are "outside" 
the entire match.

Hence, (a) the guard (not (isLocallyBoundR v2))
       (b) when we expand we nuke the renaming envt (nukeRnEnvR).

Note [Notes in RULE matching]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look through Notes in both template and expression being matched.  In
particular, we don't want to be confused by InlineMe notes.  Maybe we
should be more careful about profiling notes, but for now I'm just
riding roughshod over them.  cf Note [Notes in call patterns] in
SpecConstr

Note [Matching lets]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Matching a let-expression.  Consider
	RULE forall x.  f (g x) = <rhs>
and target expression
	f (let { w=R } in g E))
Then we'd like the rule to match, to generate
	let { w=R } in (\x. <rhs>) E
In effect, we want to float the let-binding outward, to enable
the match to happen.  This is the WHOLE REASON for accumulating
bindings in the SubstEnv

We can only do this if
  (a) Widening the scope of w does not capture any variables
      We use a conservative test: w is not already in scope
      If not, we clone the binders, and substitute
  (b) The free variables of R are not bound by the part of the
      target expression outside the let binding; e.g.
  	f (\v. let w = v+1 in g E)
      Here we obviously cannot float the let-binding for w.

You may think rule (a) would never apply, because rule matching is
mostly invoked from the simplifier, when we have just run substExpr 
over the argument, so there will be no shadowing anyway.
The fly in the ointment is that the forall'd variables of the
RULE itself are considered in scope.

I though of various ways to solve (a).  One plan was to 
clone the binders if they are in scope.  But watch out!
	(let x=y+1 in let z=x+1 in (z,z)
		--> should match (p,p) but watch out that 
		    the use of x on z's rhs is OK!
If we clone x, then the let-binding for 'z' is then caught by (b), 
at least unless we elaborate the RnEnv stuff a bit.

So for we simply fail to match unless both (a) and (b) hold.

Other cases to think about
	(let x=y+1 in \x. (x,x))
		--> let x=y+1 in (\x1. (x1,x1))
	(\x. let x = y+1 in (x,x))
		--> let x1 = y+1 in (\x. (x1,x1)
	(let x=y+1 in (x,x), let x=y-1 in (x,x))
		--> let x=y+1 in let x1=y-1 in ((x,x),(x1,x1))

Note [Matching cases]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{- NOTE: This idea is currently disabled.  It really only works if
         the primops involved are OkForSpeculation, and, since
	 they have side effects readIntOfAddr and touch are not.
	 Maybe we'll get back to this later .  -}
  
Consider
   f (case readIntOffAddr# p# i# realWorld# of { (# s#, n# #) ->
      case touch# fp s# of { _ -> 
      I# n# } } )
This happened in a tight loop generated by stream fusion that 
Roman encountered.  We'd like to treat this just like the let 
case, because the primops concerned are ok-for-speculation.
That is, we'd like to behave as if it had been
   case readIntOffAddr# p# i# realWorld# of { (# s#, n# #) ->
   case touch# fp s# of { _ -> 
   f (I# n# } } )
  
Note [Lookup in-scope]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this example
	foo :: Int -> Maybe Int -> Int
	foo 0 (Just n) = n
	foo m (Just n) = foo (m-n) (Just n)

SpecConstr sees this fragment:

	case w_smT of wild_Xf [Just A] {
	  Data.Maybe.Nothing -> lvl_smf;
	  Data.Maybe.Just n_acT [Just S(L)] ->
	    case n_acT of wild1_ams [Just A] { GHC.Base.I# y_amr [Just L] ->
	    \$wfoo_smW (GHC.Prim.-# ds_Xmb y_amr) wild_Xf
	    }};

and correctly generates the rule

	RULES: "SC:$wfoo1" [0] __forall {y_amr [Just L] :: GHC.Prim.Int#
					  sc_snn :: GHC.Prim.Int#}
	  \$wfoo_smW sc_snn (Data.Maybe.Just @ GHC.Base.Int (GHC.Base.I# y_amr))
	  = \$s\$wfoo_sno y_amr sc_snn ;]

BUT we must ensure that this rule matches in the original function!
Note that the call to \$wfoo is
	    \$wfoo_smW (GHC.Prim.-# ds_Xmb y_amr) wild_Xf

During matching we expand wild_Xf to (Just n_acT).  But then we must also
expand n_acT to (I# y_amr).  And we can only do that if we look up n_acT
in the in-scope set, because in wild_Xf's unfolding it won't have an unfolding
at all. 

That is why the 'lookupRnInScope' call in the (Var v2) case of 'match'
is so important.
