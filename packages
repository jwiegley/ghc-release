# Note that when adding libraries to this file, you also need to add
# the library to the SUBDIRS variable in libraries/Makefile so that they
# actually get built
#
# The format of the lines in this file is:
#   localpath    (optional) tag    remotepath    VCS
# where
#   * localpath is where to put the repository in a checked out tree,
#   * remotepath is where the repository is in the central repository,
#   * VCS is what version control system the repo uses,
#   * the tag, is present, determines when "darcs-all get" will get the
#     repo. If there is no tag then it will always get it, but if there
#     is a tag then a corresponding flag must be given to darcs-all, e.g.
#     if you want to get the packages with an "extralibs" or "testsuite"
#     tag then you need to use "darcs-all --extra --testsuite get".
#     Support for new tags must be manually added to the darcs-all script.
#
# Lines that start with a '#' are comments.
