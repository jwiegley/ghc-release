   * New preference 'historyDuplicates' to prevent storage of duplicate lines

   * Support PageUp and PageDown keys

   * Let ctrl-L (clear-screen) work during getInputChar

  Internal/API changes:
   * Compatibility with ghc-6.12

   * Calculate the correct width for Unicode combining characters

   * Removed RankNTypes requirement; added Rank2Types and UndecidableInstances

   * Use simpleUserHooks instead of autoconfUserHooks in the Setup script

   * Internal refactoring to make command declaration more flexible

   * Read the .haskeline file completely before starting the UI (laziness issue)
